       "'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\n\\nby J.K. Rowling\\n\\nCHAPTER ONE\\n\\nOWL POST\\n\\nHarry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he\\nhated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another,\\nhe really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret,\\nin the dead of night. And he also happened to be a wizard.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his stomach in bed, the\\nblankets drawn right over his head like a tent, a flashlight in one hand\\nand a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot)\\npropped open against the pillow. Harry moved the tip of his\\neagle-feather quill down the page, frowning as he looked for something\\nthat would help him write his essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth\\nCentury Was Completely Pointless discuss.\"\\n\\nThe quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry Pushed\\nhis round glasses up the bridge of his nose, moved his flashlight closer\\nto the book, and read:\\n\\nNon-magic people (more commonly known as Muggles) were particularly\\nafraid of magic in medieval times, but not very good at recognizing it.\\nOn the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or wizard, burning\\nhad no effect whatsoever. The witch or wizard would perform a basic\\nFlame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while enjoying\\na gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wendelin the Weird enjoyed being\\nburned so much that she allowed herself to be caught no less than\\nfortyseven times in various disguises.\\n\\nHarry put his quill between his teeth and reached underneath his pillow\\nfor his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and very carefully he\\nunscrewed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, and began to write,\\npausing every now and then to listen, because if any of the Dursleys\\nheard the scratching of his quill on their way to the bathroom, he\\'d\\nprobably find himself locked in the cupboard under the stairs for the\\nrest of the summer.\\n\\nThe Dursley family of number four, Privet Drive, was the reason that\\nHarry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and\\ntheir son, Dudley, were Harry\\'s only living relatives. They were\\nMuggles, and they had a very medieval attitude toward magic. Harry\\'s\\ndead parents, who had been a witch and wizard themselves, were never\\nmentioned under the Dursleys\\' roof For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle\\nVernon had hoped that if they kept Harry as downtrodden as possible,\\nthey would be able to squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they\\nhad been unsuccessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding\\nout that Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School\\nof Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was to lock\\naway Harry\\'s spellbooks, wand, cauldron, and broomstick at the start of\\nthe summer break, and forbid him to talk to the neighbors.\\n\\nThis separation from his spellbooks had been a real problem for Harry,\\nbecause his teachers at Hogwarts had given him a lot of holiday work.\\nOne of the essays, a particularly nasty one about shrinking potions, was\\nfor Harry\\'s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, who would be\\ndelighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention for a month. Harry\\nhad therefore seized his chance in the first week of the holidays. While\\nUncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley had gone out into the front\\ngarden to admire Uncle Vernon\\'s new company car (in very loud voices, so\\nthat the rest of the street would notice it too), Harry had crept\\ndownstairs, picked the lock on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed\\nsome of his books, and hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn\\'t\\nleave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need never know that he\\nwas studying magic by night.\\n\\nHarry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and uncle at\\nthe moment, as they were already in an especially bad mood with him, all\\nbecause he\\'d received a telephone call from a fellow wizard one week\\ninto the school vacation.\\n\\nRon Weasley, who was one of Harry\\'s best friends at Hogwarts, came from\\na whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry\\ndidn\\'t, but had never used a telephone before. Most unluckily, it had\\nbeen Uncle Vernon who had answered the call.\\n\\n\"Vernon Dursley speaking.\"\\n\\nHarry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he heard\\nRon\\'s voice answer.\\n\\n\"HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I -- WANT -- TO -- TALK -- TO -- HARRY\\n-- POTTER!\"\\n\\nRon was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held the receiver\\na foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled\\nfury and alarm.\\n\\n\"WHO IS THIS?\" he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. \"WHO ARE\\nYOU?\"\\n\\n\"RON -- WEASLEY!\" Ron bellowed back, as though he and Uncle Vernon were\\nspeaking from opposite ends of a football field. \"I\\'M -- A -- FRIEND --\\nOF -- HARRY\\'S -- FROM -- SCHOOL --\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon\\'s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was rooted to\\nthe spot.\\n\\n\"THERE IS NO HARRY POTTER HERE!\" he roared, now holding the receiver at\\narm\\'s length, as though frightened it might explode. \"I DON\\'T KNOW WHAT\\nSCHOOL YOURE TALKING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON\\'T YOU COME NEAR\\nMY FAMILY!\"\\n\\nAnd he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a\\npoisonous spider.\\n\\nThe fight that had followed had been one of the worst ever.\\n\\n\"HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS NUMBER TO PEOPLE LIKE -- PEOPLE LIKE YOU!\" Uncle\\nVernon had roared, spraying Harry with spit.\\n\\nRon obviously realized that he\\'d gotten Harry into trouble, because he\\nhadn\\'t called again. Harry\\'s other best friend from Hogwarts, Hermione\\nGranger, hadn\\'t been in touch either. Harry suspected that Ron had\\nwarned Hermione not to call, which was a pity, because Hermione, the\\ncleverest witch in Harry\\'s year, had Muggle parents, knew perfectly well\\nhow to use a telephone, and would probably have had enough sense not to\\nsay that she went to Hogwarts.\\n\\nSo Harry had had no word from any of his wizarding friends for five long\\nweeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as bad as the last\\none. There was just one very small improvement -- after swearing that he\\nwouldn\\'t use her to send letters to any of his friends, Harry had been\\nallowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in\\nbecause of the racket Hedwig made if she was locked in her cage all the\\ntime.\\n\\nHarry finished writing about Wendelin the Weird and paused to listen\\nagain. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant,\\ngrunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be very late,\\nHarry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Perhaps he\\'d finish\\nthis essay tomorrow night....\\n\\nHe replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase from\\nunder his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, quill,\\nand ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose\\nfloorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and checked the\\ntime on the luminous alarm clock on his bedside table.\\n\\nIt was one o\\'clock in the morning. Harry\\'s stomach gave a funny jolt. He\\nhad been thirteen years old, without realizing it, for a whole hour.\\n\\nYet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked forward\\nto his birthdays. He had never received a birthday card in his life. The\\nDursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, and he had no\\nreason to suppose they would remember this one.\\n\\nHarry walked across the dark room, past Hedwig\\'s large, empty cage, to\\nthe open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air pleasant on\\nhis face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig had been absent\\nfor two nights now. Harry wasn\\'t worried about her: she\\'d been gone this\\nlong before. But he hoped she\\'d be back soon -- she was the only living\\ncreature in this house who didn\\'t flinch at the sight of him.\\n\\nHarry, though still rather small and skinny for his age, had grown a few\\ninches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, was just as it\\nalways had been -- stubbornly untidy, whatever he did to it. The eyes\\nbehind his glasses were bright green, and on his forehead, clearly\\nvisible through his hair, was a thin scar, shaped like a bolt of\\nlightning.\\n\\nOf all the unusual things about Harry, this scar was the most\\nextraordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten\\nyears, a souvenir of the car crash that had killed Harry\\'s parents,\\nbecause Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had been\\nmurdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred years,\\nLord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same attack with nothing more\\nthan a scar on his forehead, where Voldemort\\'s curse, instead of killing\\nhim, had rebounded upon its originator. Barely alive, Voldemort had\\nfled....\\n\\nBut Harry had come face-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Remembering their\\nlast meeting as he stood at the dark window, Harry had to admit he was\\nlucky even to have reached his thirteenth birthday.\\n\\nHe scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring\\n\\nback to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting praise.\\nGazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds before Harry\\nrealized what he was seeing.\\n\\nSilhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every moment,\\nwas a large, strangely lopsided creature, and it was flapping in Harry\\'s\\ndirection. He stood quite still, watching it sink lower and lower. For a\\nsplit second he hesitated, his hand on the window latch, wondering\\nwhether to slam it shut. But then the bizarre creature soared over one\\nof the street lamps of Privet Drive, and Harry, realizing what it was,\\nleapt aside.\\n\\nThrough the window soared three owls, two of them holding up the third,\\nwhich appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a soft flump on\\nHarry\\'s bed, and the middle owl, which was large and gray, keeled right\\nover and lay motionless. There was a large package tied to its legs.\\n\\nHarry recognized the unconscious owl at once -- his name was Errol, and\\nhe belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed to the bed, untied the\\ncords around Errol\\'s legs, took off the parcel, and then carried Errol\\nto Hedwig\\'s cage. Errol opened one bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of\\nthanks, and began to gulp some water.\\n\\nHarry turned back to the remaining owls. One of them, the large snowy\\nfemale, was his own Hedwig. She, too, was carrying a parcel and looked\\nextremely pleased with herself. She gave Harry an affectionate nip with\\nher beak as he removed her burden, then flew across the room to join\\nErrol.\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t recognize the third owl, a handsome tawny one, but he knew\\nat once where it had come from, because in addition to a third package,\\nit was carrying a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. When Harry relieved\\nthis owl of its burden, it ruffled its feathers importantly, stretched\\nits wings, and took off through the window into the night.\\n\\nHarry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol\\'s package, ripped off the\\nbrown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and his first\\never birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened the envelope.\\nTwo pieces of paper fell out -- a letter and a newspaper clipping.\\n\\nThe clipping had clearly come out of the wizarding newspaper, the Daily\\nProphet, because the people in the black-and-white picture were moving.\\nHarry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, and read:\\n\\nMINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE\\n\\nArthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office at the\\nMinistry of Magic, has won the annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon\\nDraw.\\n\\nA delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, \"We will be spending the\\ngold on a summer holiday in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as\\na curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.\"\\n\\nThe Weasley family will be spending a month in Egypt, returning for the\\nstart of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley\\nchildren currently attend.\\n\\nHarry scanned the moving photograph, and a grin spread across his face\\nas he saw all nine of the Weasleys waving furiously at him, standing in\\nfront of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; tail, balding Mr.\\nWeasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though the black-and-white\\npicture didn\\'t show it) with flaming-red hair. Right in the middle of\\nthe picture was Ron, tall and gangling, with his pet rat, Scabbers, on\\nhis shoulder and his arm around his little sister, Ginny.\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile of gold\\nmore than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely poor. He picked\\nup Ron\\'s letter and unfolded it.\\n\\nDear Harry,\\n\\nHappy birthday!\\n\\nLook, I\\' really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the Muggles\\ndidn\\'t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he reckons I shouldn\\'t\\nhave shouted.\\n\\nIt\\'s amazing here in Egypt. Bill\\'s taken us around all the tombs and you\\nwouldn\\'t believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum\\nwouldn\\'t let Ginny come in the last one. There were all these mutant\\nskeletons in there, of Muggles who\\'d broken in and grown extra heads and\\nstuff.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet Draw. Seven hundred\\ngalleons! Most of it\\'s gone on this trip, but they\\'re going to buy me a\\nnew wand for next year.\\n\\nHarry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron\\'s old wand had\\nsnapped. It had happened when the car the two of them had been flying to\\nHogwarts had crashed into a tree on the school grounds.\\n\\nWe\\'ll be back about a week before term starts and we\\'ll be going up to\\nLondon to get my wand and our new books. Any chance of meeting you\\nthere?\\n\\nDon\\'t let the Muggles get you down!\\n\\nTry and come to London,\\n\\nRon\\n\\nP.S. Percy\\'s Head Boy. He got the letter last week.\\n\\nHarry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his seventh and\\nfinal year at Hogwarts, was looking particularly smug. He had pinned his\\nHead Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of his neat hair, his\\nhorn-rimmed glasses flashing in the Egyptian sun.\\n\\nHarry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was what looked\\nlike a miniature glass spinning top. There was another note from Ron\\nbeneath it.\\n\\nHarry -- this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there\\'s someone untrustworthy\\naround, it\\'s supposed to light up and spin. Bill says it\\'s rubbish sold\\nfor wizard tourists and isn\\'t reliable, because it kept lighting up at\\ndinner last night. But he didn\\'t realize Fred and George had put beetles\\nin his soup.\\n\\nBye --\\n\\nRon\\n\\nHarry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it stood\\nquite still, balanced on its point, reflecting the luminous hands of his\\nclock. He looked at it happily for a few seconds, then picked up the\\nparcel Hedwig had brought.\\n\\nInside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter,\\nthis time from Hermione.\\n\\nDear Harry,\\n\\nRon wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your Uncle Vernon. I\\ndo hope you\\'re all right.\\n\\nI\\'m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn\\'t know how I was going\\nto send this to you -- what if they\\'d opened it at customs? -- but then\\nHedwig turned up! I think she wanted to make sure you got something for\\nyour birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there\\nwas an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I\\'ve been getting it\\ndelivered; it\\'s so good to keep up with what\\'s going on in the wizarding\\nworld), Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ago? I bet\\nhe\\'s learning loads. I\\'m really jealous -- the ancient Egyptian wizards\\nwere fascinating.\\n\\nThere\\'s some interesting local history of witchcraft here, too. I\\'ve\\nrewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things\\nI\\'ve found out, I hope it\\'s not too long -- it\\'s two rolls of parchment\\nmore than Professor Binns asked for.\\n\\nRon says he\\'s going to be in London in the last week of the holidays.\\nCan you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope\\nyou can. If not, I\\'ll see you on the Hogwarts Express on September\\nfirst!\\n\\nLove from Hermione\\n\\nP.S. Ron says Percy\\'s Head Boy. I\\'ll bet Percy\\'s really pleased Ron\\ndoesn\\'t seem too happy about it\\n\\nHarry laughed as he put Herrmone\\'s letter aside and picked up her\\npresent. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it would be a\\nlarge book full of very difficult spells -- but it wasn\\'t. His heart\\ngave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a sleek black\\nleather case, with silver words stamped across it, reading Broomstick\\nServicing Kit.\\n\\n\"Wow, Hermione!\" Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look inside.\\n\\nThere was a large jar of Fleetwood\\'s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair\\nof gleaming silver Tall-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on\\nyour broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself\\nBroomcare.\\n\\nApart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts\\nwas Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world -- highly\\ndangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to\\nbe a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a\\ncentury to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry\\'s\\nmost prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.\\n\\nHarry put the leather case aside and picked up his last parcel. He\\nrecognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this was from\\nHagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper. He tore off the top layer of paper and\\nglimpsed something green and leathery, but before he could unwrap it\\nproperly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, and whatever was inside it\\nsnapped loudly -- as though it had jaws.\\n\\nHarry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him anything dangerous\\non purpose, but then, Hagrid didn\\'t have a normal person\\'s view of what\\nwas dangerous. Hagrid had been known to befriend giant spiders, buy\\nvicious, three-headed dogs from men in pubs, and sneak illegal dragon\\neggs into his cabin.\\n\\nHarry poked the parcel nervously. It snapped loudly again. Harry reached\\nfor the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly in one hand, and\\nraised it over his head, ready to strike. Then he seized the rest of the\\nwrapping paper in his other hand and pulled.\\n\\nAnd out fell -- a book. Harry just had time to register its handsome\\ngreen cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster Book of\\nMonsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled sideways along\\nthe bed like some weird crab.\\n\\n\"Uh-oh,\" Harry muttered.\\n\\nThe book toppled off the bed with a loud clunk and shuffled rapidly\\nacross the room. Harry followed it stealthily. The book was hiding in\\nthe dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast\\nasleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and reached toward it.\\n\\n\"Ouch!\"\\n\\nThe book snapped shut on his hand and then flapped past him, still\\nscuttling on its covers. Harry scrambled around, threw himself forward,\\nand managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, sleepy grunt in the\\nroom next door.\\n\\nHedwig and Errol watched interestedly as Harry clamped the struggling\\nbook tightly in his arms, hurried to his chest of drawers, and pulled\\nout a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The Monster Book\\nshuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, so Harry threw it\\ndown on the bed and reached for Hagrid\\'s card.\\n\\nDear Harry,\\n\\nHappy Birthday!\\n\\nThink you might find this useful for next year. Won\\'t say no more here.\\nTell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right.\\n\\nAll the best,\\n\\nHagrid\\n\\nIt struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book would come\\nin useful, but he put Hagrid\\'s card up next to Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s,\\ngrinning more broadly than ever. Now there was only the letter from\\nHogwarts left.\\n\\nNoticing that it was rather thicker than usual, Harry slit open the\\nenvelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and read:\\n\\nDear Mr. Potter,\\n\\nPlease note that the new school year will begin on September the first.\\nThe Hogwarts Express will leave ftom King\\'s Cross station, platform nine\\nand three-quarters, at eleven o\\'clock.\\n\\nThird years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade on certain\\nweekends. Please give the enclosed permission form to your parent or\\nguardian to sign.\\n\\nA list of books for next year is enclosed. Yours sincerely,\\n\\nProfessor M. McGonagall\\n\\nDeputy Headmistress\\n\\nHarry pulled out the Hogsmeade permission form and looked at it, no\\nlonger grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade on weekends;\\nhe knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he had never set foot\\nthere. But how on earth was he going to persuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt\\nPetunia to sign the form?\\n\\nHe looked over at the alarm clock. It was now two o\\'clock in the\\nmorning.\\n\\nDeciding that he\\'d worry about the Hogsmeade form when he woke up, Harry\\ngot back into bed and reached up to cross off another day on the chart\\nhe\\'d made for himself, counting down the days left until his return to\\nHogwarts. Then he took off his glasses and lay down, eyes open, facing\\nhis three birthday cards.\\n\\nExtremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter felt just\\nlike everyone else -- glad, for the first time in his life, that it was\\nhis birthday.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWO\\n\\nAUNT MARGE\\'S BIG MISTAKE\\n\\nHarry went down to breakfast the next morning to find the three Dursleys\\nalready sitting around the kitchen table. They were watching a brand-new\\ntelevision, a welcome-home-for-the-summer present for Dudley, who had\\nbeen complaining loudly about the long walk between the fridge and the\\ntelevision in the living room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in\\nthe kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five\\nchins wobbling as he ate continually.\\n\\nHarry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, beefy man with\\nvery little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from wishing Harry a happy\\nbirthday, none of the Dursleys made any sign that they had noticed Harry\\nenter the room, but Harry was far too used to this to care. He helped\\nhimself to a piece of toast and then looked up at the reporter on the\\ntelevision, who was halfway through a report on an escaped convict:\\n\\n\"... The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely dangerous. A\\nspecial hot line has been set up, and any sighting of Black should be\\nreported immediately.\"\\n\\n\"No need to tell us he\\'s no good,\" snorted Uncle Vernon, staring over\\nthe top of his newspaper at the prisoner. \"Look at the state of him, the\\nfilthy layabout! Look at his hair!\"\\n\\nHe shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had always\\nbeen a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Compared to the man on\\nthe television, however, whose gaunt face was surrounded by a matted,\\nelbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well groomed indeed.\\n\\nThe reporter had reappeared.\\n\\n\"The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce today --\"\\n\\n\"Hang on!\" barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the reporter. \"You\\ndidn\\'t tell us where that maniac\\'s escaped from! \\\\What use is that?\\nLunatic could be coming up the street right now!\"\\n\\nAunt Petunia, who was bony and horse-faced, whipped around and peered\\nintently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt Petunia would simply\\nlove to be the one to call the hot line number. She was the nosiest\\nwoman in the world and spent most of her life spying on the boring,\\nlaw-abiding neighbors.\\n\\n\"When will they learn,\" said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his\\nlarge purple fist, \"that hanging\\'s the only way to deal with these\\npeople?\"\\n\\n\"Very true,\" said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next door\\'s\\nrunner beans.\\n\\nUncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and added, \"I\\'d\\nbetter be off in a minute, Petunia. Marge\\'s train gets in at ten.\"\\n\\nHarry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick Servicing\\nKit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump.\\n\\n\"Aunt Marge?\" he blurted out. \"Sh -- she\\'s not coming here, is she?\"\\n\\nAunt Marge was Uncle Vernon\\'s sister. Even though she was not a blood\\nrelative of Harry\\'s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia\\'s sister), he\\nhad been forced to call her \"Aunt\" all his life. Aunt Marge lived in the\\ncountry, in a house with a large garden, where she bred bulldogs. She\\ndidn\\'t often stay at Privet Drive, because she couldn\\'t bear to leave\\nher precious dogs, but each of her visits stood out horribly vividly in\\nHarry\\'s mind.\\n\\nAt Dudley\\'s fifth birthday party, Aunt Margo had whacked Harry around\\nthe shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at\\nmusical statues. A few years later, she had turned up at Christmas with\\na computerized robot for Dudley and a box of dog biscuits for Harry. On\\nher last visit, the year before Harry started at Hogwarts, Harry had\\naccidentally trodden on the tail of her favorite dog. Ripper had chased\\nHarry out into the garden and up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refused to\\ncall him off until past midnight. The memory of this incident still\\nbrought tears of laughter to Dudley\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"Marge\\'ll be here for a week,\" Uncle Vernon snarled, 11 and while we\\'re\\non the subject\" -- he pointed a fat finger threateningly at Harry -- \"we\\nneed to get a few things straight before I go and collect her.\"\\n\\nDudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. Watching Harry\\nbeing bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley\\'s favorite form of\\nentertainment.\\n\\n\"Firstly,\" growled Uncle Vernon, \"you\\'ll keep a civil tongue in your\\nhead when you\\'re talking to Marge.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Harry bitterly, \"if she does when she\\'s talking to me.\\n\\n\"Secondly,\" said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not heard Harry\\'s\\nreply, \"as Marge doesn\\'t know anything about your abnormality, I don\\'t\\nwant any -- any funny stuff while she\\'s here.\\n\\nYou behave yourself, got me?\"\\n\\n\"I will if she does,\" said Harry through gritted teeth.\\n\\n\"And thirdly,\" said Uncle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits in his\\ngreat purple face, \"we\\'ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus\\'s Secure\\nCenter for Incurably Criminal Boys.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" Harry yelled.\\n\\n\"And you\\'ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there\\'ll be trouble, spat\\nUncle Vernon.\\n\\nHarry sat there, white-faced and furious, staring at Uncle Vernon,\\nhardly able to believe it. Aunt Marge coming for a weeklong visit -- it\\nwas the worst birthday present the Dursleys had ever given him,\\nincluding that pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks.\\n\\n\"Well, Petunia,\" said Uncle Vernon, getting heavily to his feet, \"I\\'ll\\nbe off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dudley, whose attention had returned to the television now\\nthat Uncle Vernon had finished threatening Harry.\\n\\n\"Duddy\\'s got to make himself smart for his auntie,\" said Aunt Petunia,\\nsmoothing Dudley\\'s thick blond hair. \"Mummy\\'s bought him a lovely new\\nbow tie.\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his porky shoulder. \"See you in a bit,\\nthen,\" he said, and he left the kitchen.\\n\\nHarry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a sudden\\nidea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and followed\\nUncle Vernon to the front door.\\n\\nUncle Vernon was pulling on his car coat.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not taking you,\" he snarled as he turned to see Harry watching him.\\n\\n\"Like I wanted to come,\" said Harry coldly. \"I want to ask you\\nsomething.\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously.\\n\\n\"Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village\\nsometimes,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"So?\" snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook next to the\\ndoor.\\n\\n\"I need you to sign the permission form,\" said Harry in a rush.\\n\\n\"And why should I do that?\" sneered Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Harry, choosing his words carefully, \"it\\'ll be hard work,\\npretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits --\"\\n\\n\"St. Brutus\\'s Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys!\" bellowed Uncle\\nVernon, and Harry was pleased to hear a definite note of panic in Uncle\\nVernon\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"Exactly,\" said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon\\'s large,\\npurple face. \"It\\'s a lot to remember. I\\'ll have to make it sound\\nconvincing, won\\'t I? What if I accidentally let something slip?\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won\\'t you?\" roared Uncle\\nVernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his\\nground.\\n\\n\"Knocking the stuffing out of me won\\'t make Aunt Marge forget what I\\ncould tell her,\" he said grimly.\\n\\nUncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly puce.\\n\\n\"But if you sign my permission form,\" Harry went on quickly, \"I swear\\nI\\'ll remember where I\\'m supposed to go to school, and I\\'ll act like a\\nMug -- like I\\'m normal and everything.\"\\n\\nHarry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if his\\nteeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple.\\n\\n\"Right,\" he snapped finally. \"I shall monitor your behavior carefully\\nduring Marge\\'s visit. If, at the end of it, you\\'ve toed the line and\\nkept to the story, I\\'ll sign your ruddy form.\"\\n\\nHe wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it so hard\\nthat one of the little panes of glass at the top fell out.\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to his\\nbedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he\\'d better start\\nnow. Slowly and sadly he gathered up all his presents and his birthday\\ncards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his homework. Then he\\nwent to Hedwig\\'s cage. Errol seemed to have recovered; he and Hedwig\\nwere both asleep, heads under their wings. Harry sighed, then poked them\\nboth awake.\\n\\n\"Hedwig,\" he said gloomily, \"you\\'re going to have to clear off for a\\nweek. Go with Errol. Ron\\'ll look after you. I\\'ll write him a note,\\nexplaining. And don\\'t look at me like that\" -- Hedwig\\'s large amber eyes\\nwere reproachful -- \"it\\'s not my fault. It\\'s the only way I\\'ll be\\nallowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.\"\\n\\nTen minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron bound to her\\nleg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling\\nthoroughly miserable, put the empty cage away inside the wardrobe.\\n\\nBut Harry didn\\'t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt Petunia\\nwas shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get ready to\\nwelcome their guest.\\n\\n\"Do something about your hair!\" Aunt Petunia snapped as he reached the\\nhall.\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t see the point of trying to make his hair lie flat. Aunt\\nMarge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the happier she\\nwould be.\\n\\nAll too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle Vernon\\'s car\\npulled back into the driveway, then the clunk of the car doors and\\nfootsteps on the garden path.\\n\\n\"Get the door!\" Aunt Petunia hissed at Harry.\\n\\nA feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door open.\\n\\nOn the threshold stood Aunt Marge. She was very like Uncle Vernon:\\nlarge, beefy, and purple- faced, she even had a mustache, though not as\\nbushy as his. In one hand she held an enormous suitcase, and tucked\\nunder the other was an old and evil-tempered bulldog.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s my Dudders?\" roared Aunt Marge. \"Where\\'s my neffy-poo?\"\\n\\nDudley came waddling down the hall, his blond hair plastered flat to his\\nfat head, a bow tie just visible under his many chins. Aunt Marge thrust\\nthe suitcase into Harry\\'s stomach, knocking the wind out of him, seized\\nDudley in a tight one-armed hug, and planted a large kiss on his cheek.\\n\\nHarry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt Marge\\'s hugs\\nbecause he was well paid for it, and sure enough, when they broke apart,\\nDudley had a crisp twenty-pound note clutched in his fat fist.\\n\\n\"Petunia!\" shouted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though he was a\\nhat stand. Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, Aunt Marge\\nbumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia\\'s bony cheekbone.\\n\\nUncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door.\\n\\n\"Tea, Marge?\" he said. \"And what will Ripper take?\"\\n\\n\"Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,\" said Aunt Marge as they all\\nproceeded into the kitchen, leaving Harry alone in the hall with the\\nsuitcase. But Harry wasn\\'t complaining; any excuse not to be with Aunt\\nMarge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the\\nspare bedroom, taking as long as he could.\\n\\nBy the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been supplied\\nwith tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in the corner.\\nHarry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea and drool flecked\\nher clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s looking after the other dogs, Marge?\" Uncle Vernon asked.\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"He\\'s\\nretired now, good for him to have something to do. But I couldn\\'t leave\\npoor old Ripper. He pines if he\\'s away from me.\"\\n\\nRipper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed Aunt\\nMarge\\'s attention to Harry for the first time.\\n\\n\"So!\" she barked. \"Still here, are you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you say yes\\' in that ungrateful tone,\" Aunt Marge growled. \"It\\'s\\ndamn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. Wouldn\\'t have done it\\nmyself. You\\'d have gone straight to an orphanage if you\\'d been dumped on\\nmy doorstep.\"\\n\\nHarry was bursting to say that he\\'d rather live in an orphanage than\\nwith the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form stopped him. He\\nforced his face into a painful smile.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you smirk at me!\" boomed Aunt Marge. \"I can see you haven\\'t\\nimproved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock some manners\\ninto you.\" She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said,\\n\"Where is it that you send him, again, Vernon?\"\\n\\n\"St. Brutus\\'s,\" said Uncle Vernon promptly. \"It\\'s a first-rate\\ninstitution for hopeless cases.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Aunt Marge. \"Do they use the cane at St. Brutus\\'s, boy?\"\\nshe barked across the table.\\n\\n\"Er --\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge\\'s back.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing properly,\\nhe added, \"all the time.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent,\" said Aunt Marge. \"I won\\'t have this namby-pamby,\\nwishy-washy nonsense about not hitting people who deserve it. A good\\nthrashing is what\\'s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred. Have\\nyou been beaten often?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yeah,\" said Harry, \"loads of times.\"\\n\\nAunt Marge narrowed her eyes.\\n\\n\"I still don\\'t like your tone, boy,\" she said. \"If you can speak of your\\nbeatings in that casual way, they clearly aren\\'t hitting you hard\\nenough. Petunia, I\\'d write if I were you. Make it clear that you approve\\nthe use of extreme force in this boy\\'s case.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their bargain;\\nin any case, he changed the subject abruptly.\\n\\n\"Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped prisoner,\\neh?\"\\n\\nAs Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught himself\\nthinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. Uncle\\nVernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay out of their\\nway, which Harry was only too happy to do. Aunt Marge, on the other\\nhand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, so that she could boom\\nout suggestions for his improvement. She delighted in comparing Harry\\nwith Dudley, and took huge pleasure in buying Dudley expensive presents\\nwhile glaring at Harry, as though daring him to ask why he hadn\\'t got a\\npresent too. She also kept throwing out dark hints about what made Harry\\nsuch an unsatisfactory person.\\n\\n\"You mustn\\'t blame yourself for the way the boy\\'s turned out, Vernon,\"\\nshe said over lunch on the third day. \"If there\\'s something rotten on\\nthe inside, there\\'s nothing anyone can do about it.\"\\n\\nHarry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and his face\\nwas starting to burn with anger. Remember the form, he told himself\\nThink about Hogsmeade. Don\\'t say anything. Don\\'t rise\\n\\nAunt Marge reached for her glass of wine.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of the basic rules of breeding,\" she said. \"You see it all the\\ntime with dogs. If there\\'s something wrong with the bitch, there\\'ll be\\nsomething wrong with the pup --\"\\n\\nAt that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding exploded in her\\nhand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered\\nand blinked, her great ruddy face dripping.\\n\\n\"Marge!\" squealed Aunt Petunia. \"Marge, are you all right?\"\\n\\n\"Not to worry,\" grunted Aunt Marge, mopping her face with her napkin.\\n\"Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing at Colonel Fubster\\'s\\nthe other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have a very firm grip...\"\\n\\nBut Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry\\nsuspiciously, so he decided he\\'d better skip dessert and escape from the\\ntable as soon as he could.\\n\\nOutside in the hall, he leaned against the wall, breathing deeply It had\\nbeen a long time since he\\'d lost control and made something explode. He\\ncouldn\\'t afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn\\'t the\\nonly thing at stake -- if he carried on like that, he\\'d be in trouble\\nwith the Ministry of Magic.\\n\\nHarry was still an underage wizard, and he was forbidden by wizard law\\nto do magic outside school. His record wasn\\'t exactly clean either. Only\\nlast summer he\\'d gotten an official warning that had stated quite\\nclearly that if the Ministry got wind of any more magic in Privet Drive,\\nHarry would face expulsion from Hogwarts.\\n\\nHe heard the Dursleys leaving the table and hurried upstairs out of the\\nway.\\n\\nHarry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think about\\nhis Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt Marge started on\\nhim. This worked quite well, though it seemed to give him a glazed look,\\nbecause Aunt Marge started voicing the opinion that he was mentally\\nsubnormal.\\n\\nAt last, at long last, the final evening of Marge\\'s stay arrived. Aunt\\nPetunia cooked a fancy dinner and Uncle Vernon uncorked several bottles\\nof wine. They got all the way through the soup and the salmon without a\\nsingle mention of Harry\\'s faults; during the lemon meringue pie, Uncle\\nVernon bored them A with a long talk about Grunnings, his drill-making\\ncompany; then Aunt Petunia made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a\\nbottle of brandy.\\n\\n\"Can I tempt you, Marge?\"\\n\\nAunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face was very\\nred.\\n\\n\"Just a small one, then,\" she chuckled. \"A bit more than that... and a\\nbit more... that\\'s the ticket.\"\\n\\nDudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sipping\\ncoffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted to\\ndisappear into his bedroom, but he met Uncle Vernon\\'s angry little eyes\\nand knew he would have to sit it out.\\n\\n\"Aah,\" said Aunt Marge, smacking her lips and putting the empty brandy\\nglass back down. \"Excellent nosh, Petunia. It\\'s normally just a fry-up\\nfor me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after....\" She burped\\nrichly and patted her great tweed stomach. \"Pardon me. But I do like to\\nsee a healthy-sized boy,\" she went on, winking at Dudley. \"You\\'ll be a\\nproper-sized man, Dudders, like your father. Yes, I\\'ll have a spot more\\nbrandy, Vernon....\"\\n\\n\"Now, this one here --\"\\n\\nShe jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The Handbook,\\nhe thought quickly.\\n\\n\"This one\\'s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with dogs. I\\nhad Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ratty little thing it was-\\nWeak. Underbred.\"\\n\\nHarry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A Charm to Cure\\nReluctant Reversers. \"It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the\\nother day.\\n\\nBad blood will out. Now, I\\'m saying nothing against your family,\\nPetunia\" she patted Aunt Petunia\\'s bony hand with her shovellike one\\n\"but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best families. Then\\nshe ran off with a wastrel and here\\'s the result right in front of us.\"\\n\\nHarry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp your\\nbroom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn\\'t remember what came\\nnext. Aunt Marge\\'s voice seemed to be boring into him like one of Uncle\\nVernon\\'s drills.\\n\\n\"This Potter, 5) said Aunt Marge loudly, seizing the brandy bottle and\\nsplashing more into her glass and over the tablecloth, \"you never told\\nme what he did?\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. Dudley had\\neven looked up from his pie to gape at his parents.\\n\\n\"He -- didn\\'t work,\" said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at Harry.\\n\"Unemployed.\"\\n\\n\"As I expected!\" said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy and\\nwiping her chin on her sleeve. \"A no-account, good-for-nothing, lazy\\nscrounger who --\"\\n\\n\"He was not,\" said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. Harry was\\nshaking all over. He had never felt so angry in his life.\\n\\n\"MORE BRANDY!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very white. He emptied\\nthe bottle into Aunt Marge\\'s glass. \"You, boy,\" he snarled at Harry. \"Go\\nto bed, go on --\"\\n\\n\"No, Vernon,\" hiccuped Aunt Marge, holding up a hand, her tiny bloodshot\\neyes fixed on Harry\\'s. \"Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are\\nyou? They go and get themselves killed in a car crash (drunk, I expect)\\n--\"\\n\\n\\'They didn\\'t die in a car crash!\" said Harry, who found himself on his\\nfeet.\\n\\n\"They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to be a\\nburden on their decent, hardworking relatives!\" screamed Aunt Marge,\\nswelling with fury. \"You are an insolent, ungrateful little --\"\\n\\nBut Aunt Marge suddenly stopped speaking. For a moment, it looked as\\nthough words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling with\\ninexpressible anger -- but the swelling didn\\'t stop. Her great red face\\nstarted to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth stretched too\\ntightly for speech -- next second, several buttons had just burst from\\nher tweed jacket and pinged off the walls -- she was inflating like a\\nmonstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband,\\neach of her fingers blowing up like a salami --\\n\\n\"MARGE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as Aunt Marge\\'s\\nwhole body began to rise off her chair toward the ceiling. She was\\nentirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy eyes, and her\\nhands and feet stuck out weirdly as she drifted up into the air, making\\napoplectic popping noises. Ripper came skidding into the room, barking\\nmadly.\\n\\n\"NOOOOOOO!\"\\n\\nUncle Vernon seized one of Marge\\'s feet and tried to pull her down\\nagain, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second later,\\nRipper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon\\'s leg.\\n\\nHarry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, heading\\nfor the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door burst magically\\nopen as he reached it. In seconds, he had heaved his trunk to the front\\ndoor. He sprinted upstairs and threw himself under the bed, wrenching up\\nthe loose floorboard, and grabbed the pillowcase full of his books and\\nbirthday presents. He wriggled out, seized Hedwig\\'s empty cage, and\\ndashed back downstairs to his trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of\\nthe dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters.\\n\\n\"COME BACK IN HERE!\" he bellowed. \"COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!\"\\n\\nBut a reckless rage had come over Harry. He kicked his trunk open,\\npulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon.\\n\\n\"She deserved it,\" Harry said, breathing very fast. \"She deserved what\\nshe got. You keep away from me.\"\\n\\nHe fumbled behind him for the latch on the door.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going,\" Harry said. \"I\\'ve had enough.\"\\n\\nAnd in the next moment, he was out in the dark, quiet street, heaving\\nhis heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig\\'s cage under his arm.\\n\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\nTHE KNIGHT BUS\\n\\nHarry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in\\nMagnolia Crescent, panting from the effort of dragging his trunk. He sat\\nquite still, anger still surging through him, listening to the frantic\\nthumping of his heart.\\n\\nBut after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion overtook\\nhim: panic. Whichever way he looked at it, he had never been in a worse\\nfix. He was stranded, quite alone, in the dark Muggle world, with\\nabsolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done\\nserious magic, which meant that he was almost certainly expelled from\\nHogwarts. He had broken the Decree for the Restriction of Underage\\nWizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives\\nweren\\'t swooping down on him where he sat.\\n\\nHarry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent.\\n\\nWhat, was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would he\\nsimply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of Ron and\\nHermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure that, criminal\\nor not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both\\nabroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no means of contacting them.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wizard gold\\nin the money bag at the bottom of his trunk, but the rest of the fortune\\nhis parents had left him was stored in a vault at Gringotts Wizarding\\nBank in London. He\\'d never be able to drag his trunk all the way to\\nLondon. Unless...\\n\\nHe looked down at his wand, which he was still clutching in his hand. If\\nhe was already expelled (his heart was. now thumping painfully fast), a\\nbit more magic couldn\\'t hurt. He had the Invisibility Cloak he had\\ninherited from his father -- what if he bewitched the trunk to make it\\nfeather-light, tied it to his broomstick, covered himself in the cloak,\\nand flew to London? Then he could get the rest of his money out of his\\nvault and... begin his life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect,\\nbut he couldn\\'t sit on this wall forever, or he\\'d find himself trying to\\nexplain to Muggle police why he was out in the dead of night with a\\ntrunkful of spellbooks and a broomstick.\\n\\nHarry opened his trunk again and pushed the contents aside, looking for\\nthe Invisibility Cloak - but before he had found it, he straightened up\\nsuddenly, looking around him once more.\\n\\nA funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel he was\\nbeing watched, but the street appeared to be deserted, and no lights\\nshone from any of the large square houses.\\n\\nHe bent over his trunk again, but almost immediately stood up once more,\\nhis hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather than heard it:\\nsomeone or something was standing in the narrow gap between the garage\\nand the fence behind him. Harry squinted at the black alleyway. If only\\nit would move, then he\\'d know whether it was just a stray cat or --\\nsomething else.\\n\\n\"Lumos,\" Harry muttered, and a light appeared at the end of his wand,\\nalmost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the\\npebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage door\\ngleamed, and between them Harry saw, quite distinctly, the hulking\\noutline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes.\\n\\nHarry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. His wand\\nflew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his fall, and he\\nlanded, hard, in the gutter --\\n\\nThere was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to shield his\\neyes against a sudden blinding light --\\n\\nWith a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A second\\nlater, a gigantic pair of wheels and headlights screeched to a halt\\nexactly where Harry had just been lying. They belonged, as Harry saw\\nwhen he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently purple bus, which\\nhad appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over the windshield spelled\\nThe Knight Bus.\\n\\nFor a Split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly by his\\nfall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the bus and\\nbegan to speak loudly to the night.\\n\\n\"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch\\nor wizard. just stick out your wand hand, step on board) and we can take\\nyou anywhere you want to go. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be\\nyour conductor this eve --\"\\n\\nThe conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of \"Harry, who\\nwas still sitting on the ground. Harry snatched up his wand again and\\nscrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan Shunpike was only a\\nfew years older than he was, eighteen or nineteen at most, with large,\\nprotruding ears and quite a few pimples.\\n\\n\"What were you doin\\' down there?\" said Stan, dropping his professional\\nmanner.\\n\\n\"Fell over,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"\\'Choo fall over for?\" sniggered Stan.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t do it on purpose,\" said Harry, annoyed. One of the knees in\\nhis jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was\\nbleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had fallen over and turned\\naround quickly to stare at the alleyway between the garage and fence.\\nThe Knight Bus\\'s headlamps were flooding it with light, and it was\\nempty.\\n\\n\"\\'Choo lookin\\' at?\" said Stan.\\n\\n\"There was a big black thing,\" said Harry, pointing uncertainly into the\\ngap. \"Like a dog... but massive...\"\\n\\nHe looked a-round at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. With a feeling\\nof unease, Harry saw Stan\\'s eyes move to the scar on Harry\\'s forehead.\\n\\n\"Woss that on your \\'ead?\" said Stan abruptly.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If the\\nMinistry of Magic was looking for him, he didn\\'t want to make it too\\neasy for them.\\n\\n\"Woss your name?\" Stan persisted.\\n\\n\"Neville Longbottom,\" said Harry, saying the first name that came into\\nhis head. \"So -- so this bus,\" he went on quickly, hoping to distract\\nStan, \"did you say it goes anywhere?\"\\n\\n\"Yep,\" said Stan proudly, \"anywhere you like, long\\'s it\\'s on land. Can\\'t\\ndo nuffink underwater. \\'Ere,\" he said, looking suspicious again, ,You\\ndid flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand \\'and, dincha?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry quickly. \"Listen, how much would it be to get to\\nLondon?\"\\n\\n\"Eleven Sickles,\" said Stan, \"but for fifteen you get \\'or chocolate, and\\nfor fifteen you get an \\'ot water bottle an\\' a toofbrush in the color of\\nyour choice.\"\\n\\nHarry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money bag, and\\nshoved some gold into Stan\\'s hand. He and Stan then lifted his trunk,\\nwith Hedwig\\'s cage balanced on top, up the steps of the bus.\\n\\nThere were no seats; instead, half a dozen brass bedsteads stood beside\\nthe curtained windows. Candles were burning in brackets beside each bed,\\nilluminating the wood-paneled walls. A tiny wizard in a nightcap at the\\nrear of the bus muttered, \"Not now, thanks, I\\'m pickling some slugs\" and\\nrolled over in his sleep.\\n\\n\"You \\'ave this one,\" Stan whispered, shoving Harry\\'s trunk under the bed\\nright behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair in front of the\\nsteering wheel. \"This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This ,is Neville\\nLongbottom, Ern. \"\\n\\nErnie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nodded to\\nHarry, who nervously flattened his bangs again and sat down on his bed.\\n\\n\"Take \\'er away, Ern,\" said Stan, sitting down in the armchair next to\\nErnie\\'s.\\n\\nThere was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment Harry found\\nhimself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the speed of the Knight Bus.\\nPulling himself up, Harry stared out of the dark window and saw that\\nthey were now bowling along a completely different street. Stan was\\nwatching Harry\\'s stunned face with great enjoyment.\\n\\n\"This is where we was before you flagged us down,\" he said. \"Where are\\nwe, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?\"\\n\\n\"Ar,\" said Ernie.\\n\\n\"How come the Muggles don\\'t hear the bus?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Them!\" said Stan contemptuously. \"Don\\' listen properly, do they? Don\\'\\nlook properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Best go wake up Madam Marsh, Stan,\" said Ern. \"We\\'ll be in Abergavenny\\nin a minute.\"\\n\\nStan passed Harry\\'s bed and disappeared up a narrow wooden staircase.\\nHarry was still looking out of the window, feeling increasingly nervous.\\nErnie didn\\'t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The\\nKnight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but it didn\\'t hit anything; lines\\nof lampposts, mailboxes, and trash cans jumped out of its way as it\\napproached and back into position once it had passed.\\n\\nStan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch wrapped in\\na traveling cloak.\\n\\n\"\\'Ere you go, Madam Marsh,\" said Stan happily as Ern stamped on the\\nbrake and the beds slid a foot or so toward the front of the bus. Madam\\nMarsh clamped a handkerchief to her mouth and tottered down the steps.\\nStan threw her bag out after her and rammed the doors shut; there was\\nanother loud BANG, and they were thundering down a narrow country lane,\\ntrees leaping out of the way.\\n\\nHarry wouldn\\'t have been able to sleep even if he had been traveling on\\na bus that didn\\'t keep banging loudly and jumping a hundred miles at a\\ntime. His stomach churned as he fell back to wondering what was going to\\nhappen to him, and whether the Dursleys had managed to get Aunt Marge\\noff the ceiling yet.\\n\\nStan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now reading with\\nhis tongue between his teeth. A large photograph of a sunken-faced man\\nwith long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry from the front page. He\\nlooked strangely familiar.\\n\\n\"That man!\" Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. \"He was on\\nthe Muggle news!\"\\n\\nStanley turned to the front page and chuckled.\\n\\n\"Sirius Black,\" he said, nodding. \"\\'Course \\'e was on the Muggle news,\\nNeville, where you been?\"\\n\\nHe gave a superior sort of chuckle at the blank look on Harry\\'s face,\\nremoved the front page, and handed it to Harry.\\n\\n\"You oughta read the papers more, Neville.\"\\n\\nHarry held the paper up to the candlelight and read:\\n\\nBLACK STILL AT LARGE\\n\\nSirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner ever to be held in\\nAzkaban fortress, is still eluding capture, the Ministry of Magic\\nconfirmed today.\\n\\n\"We are doing all we can to recapture Black,\" said the Minister of\\nMagic, Cornelius Fudge, this morning, \"and we beg the magical community\\nto remain calm.\"\\n\\nFudge has been criticized by some members of the International\\nFederation of Warlocks for informing the Muggle Prime Minister of the\\ncrisis.\\n\\n\"Well, really, I had to, don\\'t you know,\" said an irritable Fudge.\\n\"Black is mad. He\\'s a danger to anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle.\\nI have the Prime Minister\\'s assurance that he will not breathe a word of\\nBlack\\'s true identity to anyone. And let\\'s face it-who\\'d believe him if\\nhe did?\"\\n\\nWhile Muggles have been told that Black is carrying a gun (a kind of\\nmetal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community\\nlives in fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when Black\\nmurdered thirteen people with a single curse.\\n\\nHarry looked into the shadowed eyes of Sirius Black, the only part of\\nthe sunken face that seemed alive. Harry had never met a vampire, but he\\nhad seen pictures of them in his Defense Against the Dark Arts classes,\\nand Black, with his waxy white skin, looked just like one.\\n\\n\"Scary-lookin\\' fing, inee?\" said Stan, who had been watching Harry read.\\n\\n\"He murdered thirteen people?\" said Harry, handing the page back to\\nStan, \"with one curse?\"\\n\\n\"Yep,\" said Stan, \"in front of witnesses an\\' all. Broad daylight. Big\\ntrouble it caused, dinnit, Ern?\"\\n\\n\"Ar,\" said Ern darkly.\\n\\nStan swiveled in his armchair, his hands on the back, the better to look\\nat Harry.\\n\\n\"Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-\\'Oo,\" he said.\\n\\n\"What, Voldemort?\" said Harry, without thinking.\\n\\nEven Stan\\'s pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel so hard\\nthat a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the bus.\\n\\n\"You outta your tree?\" yelped Stan. \"\\'Choo say \\'is name for?\"\\n\\n\"Sorry,\" said Harry hastily. \"Sorry, I -- I forgot --\"\\n\\n\"Forgot!\" said Stan weakly. \"Blimey, my \\'eart\\'s goin\\' that fast ...\"\\n\\n\"So -- so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?\" Harry prompted\\napologetically.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Stan, still rubbing his chest. \"Yeah, that\\'s right. Very\\nclose to You-Know-\\'Oo, they say. Anyway, when little \\'Arry Potter got\\nthe better of You-Know-\\'Oo --\"\\n\\nHarry nervously flattened his bangs down again.\\n\\n\"-- all You-Know-\\'Oo\\'s supporters was tracked down, wasn\\'t they, Ern?\\nMost of \\'em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-\\'Oo gone, and they came\\nquiet. But not Sirius Black. I \\'eard he thought \\'e\\'d be\\nsecond-in-command once You-Know-\\'Oo \\'ad taken over.\\n\\n\"Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of Muggles\\nan\\' Black took out \\'is wand and \\'e blasted \\'alf the street apart, an\\' a\\nwizard got it, an\\' so did a dozen Muggles what got in the way. \\'Orrible,\\neh? An\\' you know what Black did then?\" Stan continued in a dramatic\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Laughed,\" said Stan. \"Jus\\' stood there an\\' laughed. An\\' when\\nreinforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, I \\'e went wiv em\\nquiet as anyfink, still laughing \\'is \\'ead off. \\'Cos \\'e\\'s mad, inee, Ern?\\nInee mad?\"\\n\\n\"If he weren\\'t when he went to Azkaban, he will be now,\" said Ern in his\\nslow voice. \"I\\'d blow meself up before I set foot in that place. Serves\\nhim right, mind you ... after what he did....\"\\n\\n\"They \\'ad a job coverin\\' it up, din\\' they, Ern?\" Stan said. \"\\'Ole street\\nblown up an\\' all them Muggles dead. What was it they said ad \\'appened,\\nErn?\"\\n\\n\"Gas explosion,\" grunted Ernie.\\n\\n\"An\\' now \\'e\\'s out,\" said Stan, examining the newspaper picture of\\nBlack\\'s gaunt face again. \"Never been a breakout from Azkaban before,\\n\\'as there, Ern? Beats me \\'ow \\'e did it. Frightenin\\', eh? Mind, I don\\'t\\nfancy \\'is chances against them Azkaban guards, eh, Ern?\"\\n\\nErnie suddenly shivered.\\n\\n\"Talk about summat else, Stan, there\\'s a good lad. Them Azkaban guards\\ngive me the collywobbles.\"\\n\\nStan put the paper away reluctantly, and Harry leaned against the window\\nof the Knight Bus, feeling worse than ever. He couldn\\'t help imagining\\nwhat Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights\\' time.\\n\\n\"\\'Ear about that \\'Arry Potter? Blew up \\'is aunt! We \\'ad \\'im \\'ere on the\\nKnight Bus, di\\'n\\'t we, Ern? \\'E was tryin\\' I to run for it....\"\\n\\nHe, Harry, had broken wizard law just like Sirius Black. Was inflating\\nAunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry didn\\'t know anything\\nabout the wizard prison, though everyone he\\'d ever heard speak of it did\\nso in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent\\ntwo months there only last year. Harry wouldn\\'t soon forget the look of\\nterror on Hagrid\\'s face when he had been told where he was going, and\\nHagrid was one of the bravest people Harry knew.\\n\\nThe Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes and\\nwastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, restless and\\nmiserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry\\nhad paid for hot chocolate, but poured it all over Harry\\'s pillow when\\nthe bus moved abruptly from Anglesea to Aberdeen. One by one, wizards\\nand witches in dressing gowns and slippers descended from the upper\\nfloors to leave the bus. They all looked very pleased to go.\\n\\nFinally, Harry was the only passenger left.\\n\\n\"Right then, Neville,\" said Stan, clapping his hands, where abouts in\\nLondon?\"\\n\\n\"Diagon Alley,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Righto,\" said Stan. \"\\'Old tight, then.\"\\n\\nBANG.\\n\\nThey were thundering along Charing Cross Road. Harry sat up and watched\\nbuildings and benches squeezing themselves out of the Knight Bus\\'s way.\\nThe sky was getting a little lighter. He would lie low for a couple of\\nhours, go to Gringotts the. moment it opened, then set off -- where, he\\ndidn\\'t know.\\n\\nErn slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt in front\\nof a small and shabby- looking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, behind which lay\\nthe magical entrance to Diagon Alley.\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" Harry said to Ern.\\n\\nHe jumped down the steps and helped Stan lower his trunk and Hedwig\\'s\\ncage onto the pavement.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Harry. \"\\'Bye then!\"\\n\\nBut Stan wasn\\'t paying attention. Still standing in the doorway to the\\nbus) he was goggling at the shadowy entrance to the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\"There you are, Harry,\" said a voice.\\n\\nBefore Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the same\\ntime, Stan shouted, \"Blimey! Ern, come \\'ere! Come \\'ere I\"\\n\\nHarry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and felt a\\nbucketful of ice cascade into his stomach -- he had walked right into\\nCornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic himself.\\n\\nStan leapt onto the pavement beside them.\\n\\n\"What didja call Neville, Minister?\" he said excitedly.\\n\\nFudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked cold and\\nexhausted.\\n\\n\"Neville?\" he repeated, frowning. \"This is Harry Potter.\"\\n\\n\"I knew it!\" Stan shouted gleefully. \"Ern! Ern! Guess \\'oo Neville is,\\nErn! \\'E\\'s \\'Arry Potter! I can see \\'is scar!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Fudge testily, \"well, I\\'m very glad the Knight Bus picked\\nHarry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Cauldron now...\"\\n\\nFudge increased the pressure on Harry\\'s shoulder, and Harry found\\nhimself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bearing a\\nlantern appeared through the door behind the bar. It was Tom, the\\nwizened, toothless landlord.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got him, Minister!\" said Tom. \"Will you be wanting anything?\\nBeer? Brandy?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps a pot of tea,\" said Fudge, who still hadn\\'t let go of Harry.\\n\\nThere was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and Stan and Ern\\nappeared, carrying Harry\\'s trunk and Hedwig\\'s cage and looking around\\nexcitedly.\\n\\n\"\\'Ow come you di\\'n\\'t tell us \\'oo you are, eh, Neville?\" said Stan,\\nbeaming at Harry, while Ernie\\'s owlish face peered interestedly over\\nStan\\'s shoulder.\\n\\n\"And a private parlor, please, Tom,\" said Fudge pointedly.\\n\\n`Bye,\" Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned Fudge toward\\nthe passage that led from the bar.\\n\\n\"\\'Bye, Neville!\" called Stan.\\n\\nFudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom\\'s lantern, and\\nthen into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into\\nlife in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room.\\n\\n\"Sit down, Harry,\" said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire.\\n\\nHarry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite the glow\\nof the fire. Fudge took off his pinstriped cloak and tossed it aside,\\nthen hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down\\nopposite Harry.\\n\\n\"I am Cornelius Fudge, Harry. The Minister of Magic.\"\\n\\nHarry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once before, but\\nas he had been wearing his father\\'s Invisibility Cloak at the time,\\nFudge wasn\\'t to know that.\\n\\nTom the innkeeper reappeared, wearing an apron over his nightshirt and\\nbearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on a table\\nbetween Fudge and Harry and left the parlor, closing the door behind\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Well, Harry,\" said Fudge, pouring out tea, \"you\\'ve had us all in a\\nright flap, I don\\'t mind telling you. Running away from your aunt and\\nuncle\\'s house like that! I\\'d started to think... but you\\'re safe, and\\nthat\\'s what matters.\"\\n\\nFudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward Harry.\\n\\n\"Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then... You will be pleased\\nto hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Miss\\nMarjorie Dursley. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal\\nDepartment were dispatched to Privet Drive a few hours ago. Miss Dursley\\nhas been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no\\nrecollection of the incident at all. So that\\'s that, and no harm done.\"\\n\\nFudge smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle\\nsurveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn\\'t believe his ears,\\nopened his mouth to speak, couldn\\'t think of anything to say, and closed\\nit again.\\n\\n\"Ah, you\\'re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?\" said\\nFudge. \"Well, I won\\'t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but\\nthey are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at\\nHogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.\"\\n\\nHarry unstuck his throat.\\n\\n\"I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays,\" he\\nsaid, \"and I don\\'t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.\"\\n\\n\"Now, now, I\\'m sure you\\'ll feel differently once you\\'ve calmed down,\"\\nsaid Fudge in a worried tone. \"They are your family, after all, and I\\'m\\nsure you are fond of each other -- er -- very deep down.\"\\n\\nIt didn\\'t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting to\\nhear what was going to happen to him now.\\n\\n\"So all that remains,\" said Fudge, now buttering himself a second\\ncrumpet, \"is to decide where you\\'re going to spend the last two weeks of\\nyour vacation. I suggest you take a room here at the Leaky Cauldron and\\n\\n\"Hang on,\" blurted Harry. \"What about my punishment?\"\\n\\nFudge blinked. \"Punishment?\"\\n\\n\"I broke the law!\" Harry said. \"The Decree for the Restriction of\\nUnderage Wizardry!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear boy, we\\'re not going to punish you for a little thing like\\nthat!\" cried Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. \"It was an accident!\\nWe don\\'t send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts!\"\\n\\nBut this didn\\'t tally at all with Harry\\'s past dealings with the\\nMinistry of Magic.\\n\\n\"Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a\\npudding in my uncle\\'s house!\" he told Fudge, frowning. \"The Ministry of\\nMagic said I\\'d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic\\nthere!\"\\n\\nUnless Harry\\'s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly looking\\nawkward.\\n\\n\"Circumstances change, Harry... We have to take into account... in the\\npresent climate... Surely you don\\'t want to be expelled?\"\\n\\n\"Of course I don\\'t,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well then, what\\'s A the fuss about?\" laughed Fudge. \"Now, have a\\ncrumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom\\'s got a room for you.\"\\n\\nFudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There was\\nsomething extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at\\nthe Leaky Cauldron, if not to punish him for what he\\'d done? And now\\nHarry came to think of it, surely it wasn\\'t usual for the Minister of\\nMagic himself to get involved in matters of underage magic?\\n\\nFudge came back, accompanied by Tom the innkeeper.\\n\\n\"Room eleven\\'s free, Harry,\" said Fudge. \"I think you\\'ll be very\\ncomfortable. just one thing, and I\\'m sure you\\'ll understand... I don\\'t\\nwant you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep to Diagon\\nAlley. And you\\'re to be back here before dark each night. Sure you\\'ll\\nunderstand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry slowly, \"but why?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t want to lose you again, do we?\" said Fudge with a hearty laugh.\\n\"No, no... best we know where you are.... I mean...\"\\n\\nFudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped cloak.\\n\\n\"Well, I\\'ll be off, plenty to do, you know...\\n\\n\"Have you had any luck with Black yet?\" Harry asked.\\n\\nFudge\\'s finger slipped on the silver fastenings of his cloak.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that? Oh, you\\'ve heard -- well, no, not yet, but it\\'s only a\\nmatter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed... and they are\\nangrier than I\\'ve ever seen them.\"\\n\\nFudge shuddered slightly.\\n\\n\"So, I\\'ll say good-bye.\"\\n\\nHe held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea.\\n\\n\"Er -- Minister? Can I ask you something?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said Fudge with a smile.\\n\\n\"Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, but my\\naunt and uncle didn\\'t sign the permission form. D\\'you think you could\\n--?\"\\n\\nFudge was looking uncomfortable.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" he said. \"No, no, I\\'m very sorry, Harry, but as I\\'m not your\\nparent or guardian --\"\\n\\n\"But you I re the Minister of Magic,\" said Harry eagerly. \"If you gave\\nme permission\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,\" said Fudge flatly.\\n\\n\\'Perhaps You\\'ll be able to visit Hogsmeade next year. In fact, I think\\nit\\'s best if you don\\'t... yes... well, I\\'ll be off Enjoy your stay,\\nHarry.\"\\n\\nAnd with a last smile and shake of Harry\\'s hand, Fudge left the room.\\nTom now moved forward, beaming at Harry.\\n\\n\"If you\\'ll follow me, Mr. Potter,\" he said, \"I\\'ve already taken your\\nthings up...\"\\n\\nHarry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door with a brass\\nnumber eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened for him.\\n\\nInside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly polished oak\\nfurniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the\\nwardrobe -\\n\\n\"Hedwig!\" Harry gasped.\\n\\nThe snowy owl clicked her beak and fluttered down onto Harry\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"Very smart owl you\\'ve got there, chuckled Tom. \"Arrived about five\\nminutes after you did. If there\\'s anything you need, Mr. Potter, don\\'t\\nhesitate to ask.\"\\n\\nHe gave another bow and left.\\n\\nHarry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking Hedwig.\\nThe sky outside the window was changing rapidly from deep, velvety blue\\nto cold, steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot with gold. Harry\\ncould hardly believe that he\\'d left Privet Drive only a few hours ago,\\nthat he wasn\\'t expelled, and that he was now facing two completely\\nDursley-free weeks.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been a very weird night, Hedwig,\" he yawned.\\n\\nAnd without even removing his glasses, he slumped back onto his pillows\\nand fell asleep.\\n\\nCHAPTER FOUR\\n\\nTHE LEAKY CAULDRON\\n\\nIt took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never\\nbefore had he been able to get up whenever he wanted or eat whatever he\\nfancied. He could even go wherever he pleased, as long as it was in\\nDiagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was packed with the most\\nfascinating wizarding shops in the world, Harry felt no desire to break\\nhis word to Fudge and stray back into the Muggle world.\\n\\nHarry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where he liked\\nwatching the other guests: funny little witches from the country, up for\\na day\\'s shopping; venerable-looking wizards arguing over the latest\\narticle in Transfiguration Today; wild-looking warlocks; raucous dwarfs;\\nand once, what looked suspiciously like a hag, who ordered a plate of\\nraw liver from behind a thick woollen balaclava.\\n\\nAfter breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out his wand,\\ntap the third brick from the left above the trash bit,, and stand back\\nas the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the wall.\\n\\nHarry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating under the\\nbrightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were\\nshowing one another their purchases ( \" it , s a lunascope, old boy --\\nno more messing around with moon charts, see?\") or else discussing the\\ncase of Sirius Black (\"personalty, I won\\'t let any of the children out\\nalone until he\\'s back in Azkaban\"). Harry didn\\'t have to do his homework\\nunder the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright\\nsunshine outside Florean Fortescue\\'s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his\\nessays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart\\nfrom knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free\\nsundaes every half an hour.\\n\\nOnce Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver\\nSickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to\\nexercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He\\nhad to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts,\\nand how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to\\nstop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a\\nwizarding game rather like marbles, in which the stones squirt a\\nnasty-smelling liquid into the other player\\'s face when they lose a\\npoint). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the\\ngalaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to\\ntake another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry\\'s\\nresolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch\\nSupplies, a week after he\\'d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.\\n\\nCurious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged\\nhis way inside and squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards\\nuntil he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the most\\nmagnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.\\n\\n\"Just come out -- prototype --\" a square-jawed wizard was telling his\\ncompanion.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the fastest broom in the world, isn\\'t it, Dad?\" squeaked a boy\\nyounger than Harry, who was swinging off his father\\'s arm.\\n\\n\"Irish International Side\\'s Just put in an order for seven of these\\nbeauties!\" the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. \"And they\\'re\\nfavorites for the World Cup!\"\\n\\nA large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign\\nnext to the broom:\\n\\n** THE FIREBOLT **\\n\\nTHIS STATE-OF-THE-ART PACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE\\nHANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND HAND- NUMBERED\\nWITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG\\nIN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE\\nFIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS\\nAN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN\\nUNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.\\n\\nPrice on request... Harry didn\\'t like to think how much gold the\\nFirebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole\\nlife -- but he had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nim bus Two\\nThousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the\\nFirebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn\\'t ask for\\nthe price, but he returned, almost every day after that, just to look at\\nthe Firebolt.\\n\\nThere were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the\\nApothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his\\nschool robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he\\nvisited Madam Malkin\\'s Robes for All Occasions and bought new ones. Most\\nimportant of all, he had to buy his new schoolbooks, which would include\\nthose for his two new subjects, Care of Magical Creatures and\\nDivination.\\n\\nHarry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. Instead of\\nthe usual display of gold- embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs,\\nthere was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred\\ncopies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn pages were flying\\neverywhere as the books grappled with each other, locked together in\\nfurious wrestling matches and snapping aggressively.\\n\\nHarry pulled his booklist out of his pocket and consulted it for the\\nfirst time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the required book\\nfor Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry understood why Hagrid had said\\nit would come in useful. He felt relieved; he had been wondering whether\\nHagrid wanted help with some terrifying new pet.\\n\\nAs Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurrying toward\\nhim.\\n\\n\"Hogwarts?\" he said abruptly. \"Come to get your new books?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, \"I need --\"\\n\\n\"Get out of the way,\" said the manager impatiently, brushing Harry\\naside. He drew on a pair of very thick gloves, picked up a large,\\nknobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the Monster\\nBooks\\' cage.\\n\\n\"Hang on,\" said Harry quickly, \"I\\'ve already got one of those.\"\\n\\n\"Have you?\" A look of enormous relief spread over the manager\\'s face.\\n\"Thank heavens for that. I\\'ve been bitten five times already this\\nmorning --\"\\n\\nA loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had seized a\\nthird and were pulling it apart.\\n\\n\"Stop it! Stop it!\" cried the manager, poking the walking stick through\\nthe bars and knocking the books apart. \"I\\'m never stocking them again,\\nnever! It\\'s been bedlam! I thought we\\'d seen the worst when we bought\\ntwo hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisibility -cost a\\nfortune, and we never found them.... Well... is there anything else I\\ncan help you with?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, looking down his booklist, \"I need Unfogging the\\nFuture by Cassandra Vablatsky.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, starting Divination, are you?\" said the manager, stripping off his\\ngloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where there was a\\ncorner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was stacked with\\nvolumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against\\nShocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.\\n\\n\"Here you are,,\\' said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps to\\ntake down a thick, black- bound book. \"Unfogging the Future. Very good\\nguide to all your basic fortune-telling methods - palmistry, crystal\\nballs, bird entrails.\\n\\nBut Harry wasn\\'t listening. His eyes had fallen on another book, which\\nwas among a display on a small table: Death Omens.- What to Do When You\\nKnow the Worst Is Coming.\\n\\n\"Oh, I wouldn\\'t read that if I were you,\" said the manager lightly,\\nlooking to see what Harry was staring at. \"You\\'ll start seeing death\\nomens everywhere. It\\'s enough to frighten anyone to death. \"\\n\\nBut Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it showed a\\nblack dog large as a bear, with gleaming eyes. It looked oddly\\nfamiliar...\\n\\nThe manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry\\'s hands.\\n\\n\"Anything else?\" he said.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog\\'s and dazedly\\nconsulting his booklist. \"Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and\\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three.\"\\n\\nHarry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with his new\\nbooks under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky Cauldron, hardly\\nnoticing where he was going and bumping into several people.\\n\\nHe tramped up the stairs to his room, went inside, and tipped his books\\nonto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the windows were open and\\nsun was pouring inside. Harry could hear the buses rolling by in the\\nunseen Muggle street behind him and the sound of the invisible crowd\\nbelow in Diagon Alley. He caught sight of himself in the mirror over the\\nbasin.\\n\\n\"It can\\'t have been a death omen,\" he told his reflection defiantly. \"I\\nwas panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent.... It was\\nprobably just a stray dog....\"\\n\\nHe raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat\\n\\n\"You\\'re fighting a losing battle there, dear,\" said his mirror in a\\nvvheezy voice.\\n\\nAs the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for a\\nsign of Ron or Hermione. Plenty of Hogwarts students were arriving in\\nDiagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus\\nFinnigan and Dean Thomas, his fellow Gryffindors, in Quality Quidditch\\nSupplies, where they too were ogling the Firebolt; he also ran into the\\nreal Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, forgetful boy, outside Flourish\\nand Blotts. Harry didn\\'t stop to chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid\\nhis booklist and was being told off by his very formidable-looking\\ngrandmother. Harry hoped she never found out that he\\'d pretended to be\\nNeville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic.\\n\\nHarry woke on the last day of the holidays, thinking that he would at\\nleast meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hogwarts Express. He got\\nup, dressed, went for a last look at the Firebolt, and was just\\nwondering where he\\'d have lunch, when someone yelled his name and he\\nturned.\\n\\n\"Harry! HARRY!\"\\n\\nThey were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue\\'s Ice\\nCream Parlor -- Ron looking incredibly freckly, Her,,one very brown,\\nboth waving frantically at him.\\n\\n\"Finally!\" said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. \"We went to the\\nLeaky Cauldron, but they said you\\'d left, and we went to Flourish and\\nBlotts, and Madam Malkin\\'s, and --\"\\n\\n\"I got all my school stuff last week,\" Harry explained. \"And how come\\nYou knew I\\'m staying at the Leaky Cauldron?\" \"Dad,\" said Ron simply.\\n\\nMr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of course have\\nheard the whole story of what had happened to Aunt Marge.\\n\\n\"Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?\" said Hermione in a very\\nserious voice.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t mean to,\" said Harry, while Ron roared with laughter. \"I just\\n-- lost control.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not funny, Ron,\" said Hermione sharply. \"Honestly, I\\'m amazed\\nHarry wasn\\'t expelled.\"\\n\\n\"So am I,\" admitted Harry. \"Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be\\narrested.\" He looked at Ron. \"Your dad doesn\\'t know why Fudge let me\\noff, does he?\"\\n\\n\"Probably \\'cause it\\'s you, isn\\'t it?\" shrugged Ron, still chuckling.\\n\"Famous Harry Potter and all that. I\\'d hate to see what the Ministry\\'d\\ndo to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they\\'d have to dig me up first,\\nbecause Mum would\\'ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this\\nevening. We\\'re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can\\ncome to King\\'s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione\\'s there as well!\"\\n\\nHermione nodded, beaming. \"Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with\\nall my Hogwarts things.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent!\" said Harry happily. \"So, have you got all your new books\\nand stuff?\"\\n\\n\"Look at this,\" said Ron, pulling a long thin box out of a bag and\\nopening it. \"Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one\\nunicorn tail-hair. And we\\'ve got all our books --\" He pointed at a large\\nbag under his chair. \"What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant\\nnearly cried when we said we wanted two.\"\\n\\n\\n\"What\\'s all that, Hermione?\" Harry asked, pointing at not one but three\\nbulging bags in the chair next to her.\\n\\n,,Well, I\\'m taking more new subjects than you, aren\\'t IF\\' said Hermione.\\n\"Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures,\\nDivination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies --\"\\n\\n\"What are you doing Muggle Studies for?\" said Ron, rolling his eyes at\\nHarry. \"You\\'re Muggle- born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already\\nknow all about Muggles!\"\\n\\n\"But it\\'ll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of\\nview,\" said Hermione earnestly.\\n\\n\"Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?\" asked\\nHarry, while Ron sniggered. Hermione ignored them.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve still got ten Galleons,\" she said, checking her purse. \"It\\'s my\\nbirthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself\\nan early birthday present.\"\\n\\n\"How about a nice book? said Ron innocently.\\n\\n\"No, I don\\'t think so,\" said Hermione composedly. \"I really want an owl.\\nI mean, Harry\\'s got Hedwig and you\\'ve got Errol --\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t,\" said Ron. \"Errol\\'s a family owl. All I\\'ve got is Scabbers.\"\\nHe pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. \"And I want to get him checked\\nover,\" he added, placing Scabbers on the table in front of them. \"I\\ndon\\'t think Egypt agreed with him.\"\\n\\nScabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a definite droop\\nto his whiskers.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a magical creature shop just over there,\" said Harry, who knew\\nDiagon Alley very well by now. \"You could see if they\\'ve got anything\\nfor Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl,\"\\n\\nSo they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the Magical\\nMenagerie.\\n\\nThere wasn\\'t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden by cages.\\nIt was smelly and very noisy because the occupants Of these cages were\\nall squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. The witch behind the\\ncounter was already advising a wizard on the care of double-ended newts,\\nso Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, examining the cages.\\n\\nA pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting on dead\\nblowflies. A gigantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell was\\nglittering near the window. Poisonous orange snails were oozing slowly\\nup the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept changing\\ninto a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping noise. Then there\\nwere cats of every color, a noisy cage of ravens, a basket of funny\\ncustard-colored furballs that were humming loudly, and on the counter, a\\nvast cage of sleek black rats that were playing some sort of skipping\\ngame using their long, bald tails.\\n\\nThe double-ended newt wizard left, and Ron approached the counter.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my rat,\" he told the witch. \"He been a bit off-color ever since I\\nbrought him back from Egypt.\"\\n\\n\"Bang him on the counter,\" said the witch, pulling a pair of heavy black\\nspectacles out of her pocket.\\n\\nRon lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next to the\\ncage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled\\nto the wire for a better took.\\n\\nLike nearly everything Ron owned, Scabbers the rat was secondhand (he\\nhad once belonged to Ron\\'s brother Percy) and a bit battered. Next to\\nthe glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially woebegone.\\n\\n\"Hm,\" said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \"How old is this rat?\"\\n\\n\"Dunno,\" said Ron. \"Quite old. He used to belong to my brother.\"\\n\\n\"What powers does he have?\" said the witch, examining Scabbers closely.\\n\\n\"Er --\" The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the faintest trace\\nof interesting powers. The witchs eyes moved from Scabbers\\'s tattered\\nleft ear to his front paw, which had a toe missing, and tutted loudly.\\n\\n\"He\\'s been through the mill, this one,\" she said.\\n\\n\"He was like that when Percy gave him to me,\" said Ron defensively.\\n\\n\"An ordinary common or garden rat like this can\\'t be expected to live\\nlonger than three years or so,\" said the witch. \"Now, if you were\\nlooking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might like one of\\nthese --\"\\n\\nShe indicated the black rats, who promptly started skipping again. Ron\\nmuttered, \"Show-offs.\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you Don\\'t want a replacement, you can try this rat tonic,\"\\nsaid the witch, reaching under the counter and bringing out a small red\\nbottle.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Ron. \"How much -- OUCH!\"\\n\\nRon buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from the top of\\nthe highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled itself,\\nspitting madly, at Scabbers.\\n\\n\"NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!\" cried the witch, but Scabbers, shot from between\\nher hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged on the floor, and then\\nscampered for the door.\\n\\n\"Scabbers!\" Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; Harry\\nfollowed.\\n\\nIt took them nearly ten minutes to catch Scabbers, who had taken refuge\\nunder a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch Supplies. Ron stuffed\\nthe trembling rat back into his pocket and straightened up, massaging\\nhis head.\\n\\n\"What was that?\"\\n\\n\"It was either a very big cat or quite a small tiger,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Hermione?\"\\n\\n\"Probably getting her owl\\n\\nThey made their way back up the crowded street to the Magical Menagerie.\\nAs they reached it, Hermione came out, but she wasn\\'t carrying an owl.\\nHer arms were clamped tightly around the enormous ginger cat.\\n\\n\"You bought that monster?\" said Ron, his mouth hanging open.\\n\\n\"He\\'s gorgeous, isn\\'t he?\" said Hermione, glowing.\\n\\nThat was a matter of opinion, thought Harry. The cat\\'s ginger fur was\\nthick and fluffy, but it was definitely a bit bowlegged and its face\\nlooked grumpy and oddly squashed, as though it had run headlong into a\\nbrick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was\\npurring contentedly in Hermione\\'s arms.\\n\\n\"Herinione, that thing nearly scalped me!\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"He didn\\'t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"And what about Scabbers?\" said Ron, pointing at the lump in his chest\\npocket. \"He needs rest and relaxation! How\\'s he going to get it with\\nthat thing around?\"\\n\\n\"That reminds me, you forgot your rat tonic,\" said Hermione, slapping\\nthe small red bottle into Ron\\'s hand. \"And stop worrying, Crookshanks\\nwill be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in yours, what\\'s the\\nproblem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he\\'d been in there for ages;\\nno one wanted him.\"\\n\\n\"Wonder why,\" said Ron sarcastically as they set off toward the Leaky\\nCauldron.\\n\\nThey found Mr. Weasley sitting in the bar, reading the Daily prophet.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" he said, smiling as he looked up. \"How are you?\"\\n\\n\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. Weasley\\nwith A their shopping.\\n\\nMr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now familiar picture\\nof Sirius Black staring up at him.\\n\\n\"They still haven\\'t caught him, then?\" he asked.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Mr. Weasley, looking extremely grave. \"They\\'ve pulled us all\\noff our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find him, but no luck so\\nfar.\"\\n\\n\"Would we get a reward if we caught him?\" asked Ron. \"It\\'d be good to\\nget some more money --\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be ridiculous, Ron,\" said Mr. Weasley, who on closer inspection\\nlooked very strained. \"Black\\'s not going to be caught by a\\nthirteen-year-old wizard. It\\'s the Azkaban guards who\\'ll get him back,\\nYou mark my words.\"\\n\\nAt that moment Mrs. Weasley entered the bar, laden with shopping bags\\nand followed by the twins, Fred and George, who were about to start\\ntheir fifth year at Hogwarts; the newly elected Head Boy, Percy; and the\\nWeasleys\\' youngest child and only girl, Ginny.\\n\\nGinny, who had always been very taken with Harry, seemed even more\\nheartily embarrassed than usual when she saw him, perhaps because he had\\nsaved her life during their previous year at Hogwarts. She went very red\\nand muttered \"hello\" without looking at him. Percy, however, held out\\nhis hand solemnly as though he and Harry had never met and said, \"Harry.\\nHow nice to see you.\\n\\n\"Hello, Percy,\" said Harry, trying not to laugh.\\n\\nI hope you\\'re well?\" said Percy pompously, shaking hands. It was rather\\nlike being introduced to the mayor.\\n\\n\"Very well, thanks --\"\\n\\n\"Harry!\" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply.\\n\"Simply splendid to see you, old boy --\"\\n\\n\"Marvelous,\" said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry\\'s hand in\\nturn. \"Absolutely spiffing.\"\\n\\nPercy scowled.\\n\\n\"That\\'s enough, now,\" said Mrs. Weasley.\\n\\n\"Mum!\" said Fred as though he\\'d only just spotted her and seizing her\\nhand too. \"How really corking to see you --\"\\n\\n\"I said, that\\'s enough,\" said Mrs. Weasley, depositing her shopping in\\nan empty chair. \"Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you\\'ve heard our exciting\\nnews?\" She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on Percy\\'s chest.\\n\"Second Head Boy in the family!\" she said, swelling with pride.\\n\\n\"And last,\" Fred muttered under his breath.\\n\\nI don\\'t doubt that,\" said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. \"I notice\\nthey haven\\'t made you two prefects.\"\\n\\n\"What do we want to be prefects for?\" said George, looking revolted at\\nthe very idea. \"It\\'d take all the fun out of life.\"\\n\\nGinny giggled.\\n\\n\"Yo u want to set a better example for your sister!\" snapped Mrs.\\nWeasley.\\n\\n\"Ginny\\'s got other brothers to set her an example, Mother,\" said Percy\\nloftily. \"I\\'m going up to change for dinner...\"\\n\\nHe disappeared and George heaved a sigh.\\n\\n\"We tried to shut him in a pyramid,\" he told Harry. \"But Mum spotted\\nus.\"\\n\\nDinner that night was a very enjoyable affair. Tom the innkeeper put\\nthree tables together in the parlor, and the seven Weasleys, Harry, and\\nHermione ate their way through five delicious courses.\\n\\n\"How\\'re we getting to King\\'s Cross tomorrow, Dad?\" asked Fred as they\\ndug into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.\\n\\n\"The Ministry\\'s providing a couple of cars,\" said Mr. Weasley.\\n\\nEveryone looked up at him.\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Percy curiously.\\n\\n\"It\\'s because of you, Perce,\" said George seriously. \"And there\\'ll be\\nlittle flags on the hoods, with HB on them\"\\n\\n\"-- for Humongous Bighead,\" said Fred.\\n\\nEveryone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pudding.\\n\\n\"Why are the Ministry providing cars, Father?\" Percy asked again, in a\\ndignified voice.\\n\\n\"Well, as we haven\\'t got one anymore,\" said Mr. Weasley,\\n\\n\"-- and as I work there, they\\'re doing me a favor --\"\\n\\nHis voice was casual, but Harry couldn\\'t help noticing that Mr.\\nWeasley\\'s ears had gone red, just like Ron\\'s did when he was under\\nPressure.\\n\\n\"Good thing, too,\" said Mrs. Weasley briskly. \"Do you realize how much\\nluggage you\\'ve all got between you? A nice sight you\\'d be on the Muggle\\nUnderground.... You are all packed, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Ron hasn\\'t put all his new things in his trunk yet,\" said Percy, in a\\nlong-suffering voice. \"He\\'s dumped them on my bed.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won\\'t have much time\\nin the morning,\" Mrs. Weasley called down the table. Ron scowled at\\nPercy.\\n\\nAfter dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they made\\ntheir way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next\\nday. Ron and Percy were next door to Harry. He had just closed and\\nlocked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and\\nwent to see what was going on.\\n\\nThe door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting.\\n\\n\"It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t touched it, all right?\" Ron roared back.\\n\\n\"What\\'s up?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"My Head Boy badge is gone,\" said Percy, rounding on Harry.\\n\\n\"So\\'s Scabbers\\'s rat tonic,\" said Ron, throwing things out of his trunk\\nto look. \"I think I might\\'ve left it in the bar --\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re not going anywhere till you\\'ve found my badge!\" yelled Percy.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll get Scabbers\\'s stuff, I\\'m packed,\" Harry said to Ron, and he went\\ndownstairs.\\n\\nHarry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark,\\nwhen he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A\\nsecond later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.\\n\\nWeasleys\\'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he\\'d heard them\\narguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer\\nto the parlor door.\\n\\n\"--makes no sense not to tell him,\" Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly.\\n\"Harry\\'s got a right to know. I\\'ve tried to tell Fudge, but he insists\\non treating Harry like a child. He\\'s thirteen years old and --\"\\n\\n\"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!\" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \"Do\\nyou really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him?\\nFor heaven\\'s sake, he\\'s happy not knowing!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\"\\nretorted Mr. Weasley. \"You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering\\noff by themselves -- they\\'ve ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! But\\nHarry mustn\\'t do that this year! When I think what could have happened\\nto him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn\\'t picked\\nhim up, I\\'m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry\\nfound him.\"\\n\\n\"But he\\'s not dead, he\\'s fine, so what\\'s the point\\n\\n\"Molly, they say Sirius Black\\'s mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever\\nenough to escape from Azkaban, and that\\'s supposed to be impossible.\\nIt\\'s been three weeks, and no one\\'s seen hide nor hair of him, and I\\ndon\\'t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we\\'re no nearer\\ncatching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we\\nknow for sure is what Black\\'s after\\n\\n\"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\"\\n\\n\"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of\\nAzkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.\"\\n\\n\"But no one\\'s really sure that Black\\'s after Harry\\n\\nThere was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his\\nfist on the table.\\n\\n\"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn\\'t report it in\\nthe press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to\\nAzkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been\\ntalking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: \\'He\\'s at\\nHogwarts... he\\'s at Hogwarts.\\' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants\\nHarry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring\\nYou-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry\\nstopped You- Know-Who, and he\\'s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to\\nbrood on that....\"\\n\\nThere was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to\\nhear more.\\n\\n\"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you\\'re\\nforgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don\\'t think anything could hurt Harry at\\nHogwarts while Dumbledore\\'s headmaster. I suppose he knows about all\\nthis?\"\\n\\n\"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards\\nstationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He\\nwasn\\'t happy about it, but he agreed.\"\\n\\n\"Not happy? Why shouldn\\'t he be happy, if they\\'re there to catch Black?\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore isn\\'t fond of the Azkaban guards,\" said Mr. Weasley heavily.\\n\"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you\\'re dealing with a wizard\\nlike Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you\\'d rather\\navoid.\"\\n\\n\"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them,\\nsaid Mr. Weasley wearily. \"It\\'s late, Molly, we\\'d better go up....\"\\n\\nHarry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the\\npassage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few\\nseconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing\\nthe stairs.\\n\\nThe bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at\\nearlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\\'s bedroom door\\nclose, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.\\n\\nFred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving\\nwith laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron\\'s room\\nin search of his badge.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got it,\" Fred whispered to Harry. \"We\\'ve been improving it.\"\\n\\nThe badge now read Bighead Boy.\\n\\nHarry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself\\nin his room and lay down on his bed.\\n\\nSo Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been\\nlenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He\\'d made\\nHarry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards\\nto keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them\\nall to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry\\nuntil he was on the train.\\n\\nHarry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why\\nhe didn\\'t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people\\nwith one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be\\npanic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree\\nwholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was\\nwherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn\\'t people always say that\\nDumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of?\\nSurely Black, as Voldemort\\'s right-hand man, would be just as frightened\\nof him?\\n\\nAnd then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about.\\nThey seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were stationed\\nall around the school, Black\\'s chances of getting inside seemed very\\nremote.\\n\\nNo, all in all, the thing that bothered Harry most was the fact that his\\nchances of visiting Hogsmeade now looked like zero. Nobody would want\\nHarry to leave the safety of the castle until Black was caught; in fact,\\nHarry suspected his every move would be carefully watched until the\\ndanger had passed.\\n\\nHe scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn\\'t look after\\nhimself? He\\'d escaped Lord Voldemort three times; he wasn\\'t completely\\nuseless....\\n\\nUnbidden, the image of the beast in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent\\ncrossed his mind. What to do when you know the worst is coming...\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to be murdered,\" Harry said out loud.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the spirit, dear,\" said his mirror sleepily.\\n\\nCHAPTER FIVE\\n\\nTHE DEMENTOR\\n\\nTom woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup\\nof tea. Harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled Hedwig\\nto get back into her cage when Ron banged his way into the room, pulling\\na sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable.\\n\\n\"The sooner we get on the train, the better,\" he said. \"At least I can\\nget away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he\\'s accusing me of dripping tea on\\nhis photo of Penelope Clearwater. You know,\" Ron grimaced, \"his\\ngirlfriend. She\\'s hidden her face under the frame because her nose has\\ngone all blotchy...\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got something to tell you,\" Harry began, but they were interrupted\\nby Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate Ron on infuriating\\nPercy again.\\n\\nThey headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading the front\\npage of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. Weasley was\\ntelling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she\\'d made as a young\\ngirl. All three of them were rather giggly.\\n\\n\"What were you saying?\" Ron asked Harry as they sat down.\\n\\n\"Later,\" Harry muttered as Percy stormed in.\\n\\nHarry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos of leaving;\\nthey were too busy heaving all their trunks down the Leaky Cauldron\\'s\\nnarrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and\\nHermes, Percy\\'s screech owl, perched on top in their cages. A small\\nwickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks, spitting loudly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s all right, Crookshanks,\" Hermione cooed through the wickerwork.\\n\"I\\'ll let you out on the train.\"\\n\\n\"You won\\'t,\" snapped Ron. \"What about poor Scabbers, eh?\"\\n\\nHe pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scabbers was\\ncurled up in his pocket.\\n\\nMr. Weasley, who had been outside waiting for the Ministry cars, stuck\\nhis head inside.\\n\\n\"They\\'re here, he said. \"Harry, come on.\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley marched Harry across the short stretch of pavement toward\\nthe first of two old- fashioned dark green cars, each of which was\\ndriven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet.\\n\\n\"In you get, Harry,\" said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the crowded\\nstreet.\\n\\nHarry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by Hermione,\\nRon, and, to Ron\\'s disgust, Percy.\\n\\nThe journey to King\\'s Cross was very uneventful compared with Harry\\'s\\ntrip on the Knight Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed almost\\nordinary. though Harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that\\nUncle Vernon\\'s new company car certainly couldn\\'t have managed. They\\nreached King\\'s Cross with twenty minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers\\nfound them trolleys, unloaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute\\nto Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of\\nan unmoving line at the traffic lights.\\n\\nMr. Weasley kept close to Harry\\'s elbow all the way into the station.\\n\\n\"Right then,\" he said, glancing around them. \"Let\\'s do this in pairs, as\\nthere are so many of us. I\\'ll go through first with Harry.\"\\n\\nMr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten,\\npushing Harry\\'s trolley and apparently very interested in the InterCity\\n125 that had just arrived at platform nine. With a meaningful look at\\nHarry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him.\\n\\nIn a moment, they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto\\nplatform nine and three- quarters and looked up to see the Hogwarts\\nExpress, a scarlet steam engine, puffing smoke over a platform packed\\nwith witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train.\\n\\nPercy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were panting and\\nhad apparently taken the barrier at a run.\\n\\n\"Ah, there\\'s Penelope!\" said Percy, smoothing his hair and going Pink\\nagain. Ginny caught Harry\\'s eye, and they both turned away to hide their\\nlaughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly hair, walking\\nwith his chest thrown out so that she couldn\\'t miss his shiny badge.\\nstood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and waved at Mr.\\nand Mrs. Weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from\\nview.\\n\\n\"I need to talk to you in private,\" Harry muttered to Ron and Hermione\\nas the train picked up speed.\\n\\n\"Go away, Ginny,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s nice,\" said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the corridor, looking for an empty\\ncompartment, but all were full except for the one at the very end of the\\ntrain.\\n\\nThis had only one occupant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the\\nwindow. Harry, Ron, and Hermione checked on the threshold. The Hogwarts\\nExpress was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an\\nadult there before, except for the witch who pushed the food cart.\\n\\nThe stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of wizard\\'s robes that\\nhad been darned in several places. He looked ill and exhausted. Though\\nquite young, his light brown hair was flecked with gray.\\n\\n\"Who d\\'you reckon he is?\" Ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door\\nshut, taking the seats farthest away from the window.\\n\\n\"Professor R. J. Lupin,\" whispered Hermione at once.\\n\\n\"How d\\'you know that?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s on his case,\" she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the\\nman\\'s head, where there was a small, battered case held together with a\\nlarge quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin\\nwas stamped across one corner in peeling letters.\\n\\n\"Wonder what he teaches?\" said Ron, frowning at Professor Lupin\\'s pallid\\nprofile.\\n\\n\"That\\'s obvious,\" whispered Hermione. \"There\\'s only one vacancy, isn\\'t\\nthere? Defense Against the Dark Arts.\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense Against the Dark\\nArts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one year. There were rumors\\nthat the job was jinxed.\\n\\n\"well, I hope he\\'s up to it,\" said Ron doubtfully. \"He looks like on,\\ngood hex would finish him off, doesn\\'t he? Anyway...\" He turned to\\nHarry. \"What were you going to tell us?\"\\n\\nHarry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\\'s argument and the\\nwarning Mr. Weasley had just given him. \\\\When he\\'d finished, Ron looked\\nthunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her mouth. She finally\\nlowered them to say, \"Sirius Black escaped to come after you? Oh,\\nHarry... you\\'ll have to be really, really careful. don\\'t go looking for\\ntrouble, Harry --\"\\n\\n\"I Don\\'t go looking for trouble,\" said Harry, nettled. \"Trouble usually\\nfinds me.\"\\n\\n\"How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants\\nto kill him?\" said Ron shakily.\\n\\nThey were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. Both Ron and\\nHermione seemed to be much more frightened of Black than he was.\\n\\n\"No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,\" said Ron uncomfortably. \"No\\none\\'s ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.\"\\n\\n\"But they\\'ll catch him, won\\'t they?\" said Hermione earnestly. \"I Mean,\\nthey\\'ve got all the Muggles looking out for him too....\" \"What\\'s that\\nnoise?\" said Ron suddenly.\\n\\nA faint, tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere. The, looked\\nall around the compartment.\\n\\n\"It\\'s coming from your trunk, Harry,\" said Ron, standing UP and reaching\\ninto the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the Pocket\\nSneakoscope out from between Harry\\'s robes. It was spinning very fast in\\nthe palm of Ron\\'s hand and glowing brilliantly.\\n\\n\"Is that a Sneakoscope?\" said Hermione interestedly, standing up for a\\nbetter look.\\n\\n\"Yeah... mind you, it\\'s a very cheap one,\" Ron said. \"It went haywire\\njust as I was tying it to Errol\\'s leg to send it to Harry.\"\\n\\n\"Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?\" said Hermione\\nshrewdly.\\n\\n\"No! Well... I wasn\\'t supposed to be using Errol. You know he\\'s not\\nreally up to long journeys... but how else was I supposed to get Harry\\'s\\npresent to him?\"\\n\\n\"Stick it back in the trunk,\" Harry advised as the Sneakoscope whistled\\npiercingly, \"or it\\'ll wake him up.\"\\n\\nHe nodded toward Professor Lupin. Ron stuffed the Sneakoscope into a\\nparticularly horrible pair of Uncle Vernon\\'s old socks, which deadened\\nthe sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it.\\n\\n\"We could get it checked in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron, sitting back down.\\n\"They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments\\nand stuff. Fred and George told me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know much about Hogsmeade?\" asked Hermione keenly. \"I\\'ve read\\nit\\'s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain --\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I think it is,\" said Ron in an offhand sort of way.\\n\\n\"But that\\'s not Why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey\\nDukes.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"It\\'s this sweetshop,\" said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his face,\\n\"where they\\'ve got everything... Pepper Imps -- they make you smoke at\\nthe mouth -- and great fat Chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and\\nclotted cream, and really excellent sugar quills, which you can suck in\\nclass and just look like you\\'re thinking what to write next --\"\\n\\n\"But Hogsmeade\\'s a very interesting place, isn\\'t it?\" Hermione pressed\\non eagerly. \"In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was the\\nheadquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, and the Shrieking Shades\\nsupposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain --\"\\n\\n\"-- and massive sherbert balls that make you levitate a few inches off\\nthe ground while you\\'re sucking them,\" said Ron, who was plainly not\\nlistening to a word Hermione was saying.\\n\\nHermione looked around at Harry.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore Hogsmeade?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Spect it will,\" said Harry heavily. \"You\\'ll have to tell me when\\nYou\\'ve found out.\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you mean?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t go. The Dursleys didn\\'t sign my permission form, and Fudge\\nwouldn\\'t either.\"\\n\\nRon looked horrified.\\n\\n\"\"You\\'re not allowed to come? But -- no way -- McGonagall or someone\\nwill give you permission -- \" musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a\\npudding-bowl haircut and a very thick neck; Goyle had short, bristly\\nhair and long, gorilla-ish arms.\\n\\n\"Well, look who it is,\" said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, pulling\\nopen the compartment door. \"Potty and the Weasel.\"\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle chuckled trollishly.\\n\\n\"I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer,\\nWeasley,\" said Malfoy. \"Did your mother die of shock?\"\\n\\nRon stood up so quickly he knocked Crookshanks\\'s basket to the floor.\\nProfessor Lupin gave a snort.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that?\" said Malfoy, taking an automatic step backward as he\\nspotted Lupin.\\n\\n\"New teacher,\" said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he needed\\nto hold Ron back. \"What were you saying, Malfoy?\"\\n\\nMalfoy\\'s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn\\'t fool enough to pick a fight right\\nunder a teacher\\'s nose.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon,\" he muttered resentfully to Crabbe and Goyle, and they\\ndisappeared.\\n\\nHarry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,\" he said angrily.\\n\"I mean it. If he makes one more crack about my family, I\\'m going to get\\nhold of his head and --\"\\n\\nRon made a violent gesture in midair.\\n\\n\"Ron,\" hissed Hermione, pointing at Professor Lupin, \"be careful...\"\\n\\nBut Professor Lupin was still fast asleep.\\n\\nThe rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the windows were\\nnow a solid, shimmering gray, which graduily darkened until lanterns\\nflickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks.\\nThe train rattled, the rain hammered, the ind roared, but still,\\nProfessor Lupin slept.\\n\\n\"We must be nearly there,\" said Ron, leaning forward to look past\\nProfessor Lupin at the now completely black window.\\n\\nThe words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down.\\n\\n\"Great,\" said Ron, getting up and walking carefully past Professor Lupin\\nto try and see outside. \"I\\'m starving. I want to get to the feast....\\n\\n\"We can\\'t be there yet,\" said Hermione, checking her watch.\\n\\n\"So why\\'re we stopping?\"\\n\\nThe train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pistons\\nfell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the\\nwindows.\\n\\nHarry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corridor. All\\nalong the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of their\\ncompartments.\\n\\nThe train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs told\\nthem that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without warning,\\nall the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness.\\n\\n\"\\'What\\'s going on?\" said Ron\\'s voice from behind Harry.\\n\\n\"Ouch!\" gasped Hermione. \"Ron, that was my foot!\"\\n\\nHarry felt his way back to his seat.\\n\\n\"D\\'you think we\\'ve broken down?\"\\n\\n\"Dunno...\"\\n\\nThere was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black outline of Ron,\\nwiping a patch clean on the window and peering out.\\n\\n\"There\\'s something moving out there,\" Ron said. \"I think people are\\ncoming aboard....\"\\n\\nThe compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over\\nHarry\\'s legs.\\n\\n\"Sorry -- d\\'you know what\\'s going on? -- Ouch -- sorry\\n\\n\"Hullo, Neville,\" said Harry, feeling around in the dark and pulling\\nNeville up by his cloak.\\n\\n\"Harry? Is that you? What\\'s happening?\"\\n\\n\"No idea -- sit down --\"\\n\\nThere was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to sit on\\nCrookshanks.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to go and ask the driver what\\'s going on,\" came Hermione\\'s\\nvoice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide open again, and\\nthen a thud and two loud squeals of pain.\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"Ginny?\"\\n\\n\"Hermione?\"\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n\"I was looking for Ron --\" \"Come in and sit down --\"\\n\\n\"Not here!\" said Harry hurriedly. \"I\\'m here!\"\\n\\n\"Ouch!\" said Neville.\\n\\n\"Quiet!\" said a hoarse voice suddenly.\\n\\nProfessor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could hear\\nmovements in his corner.\\n\\nNone of them spoke.\\n\\nThere was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the\\ncompartment. Professor Lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames.\\nThey illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked alert and\\nwary.\\n\\n\"Stay where you are,\" he said in the same hoarse voice, and he got\\nslowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him.\\n\\nBut the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it.\\n\\nStanding in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in Lupin\\'s\\nhand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its face was\\ncompletely hidden beneath its hood. Harry\\'s eyes darted downward, and\\nwhat he saw made his stomach contract. There was a hand protruding from\\nthe cloak and it was glistening, grayish, slimy-looking, and scabbed,\\nlike something dead that had decayed in water...\\n\\nBut it was visible only for a split second. As though the creature\\nbeneath the cloak sensed Harry\\'s gaze, the hand was suddenly withdrawn\\ninto the folds of its black cloak.\\n\\nAnd then the thing beneath the hood, whatever it was, drew a long, slow,\\nrattling breath, as though it were trying to suck something more than\\nair from its surroundings.\\n\\nAn intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath catch in\\nhis chest. The cold went deeper than his skin. It was inside his chest,\\nit was inside his very heart....\\n\\nHarry\\'s eyes rolled up into his head. He couldn\\'t see. He was drowning\\nin cold. There was a rushing in his ears as though of water. He was\\nbeing dragged downward, the roaring growing louder. .\\n\\nAnd then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified,\\npleading screams. He wanted to help whoever it was, he tried to move his\\narms, but couldn\\'t... a thick white fog was swirling around him, inside\\nhim -\\n\\n\"Harry! Harry! Are you all right?\"\\n\\nSomeone was slapping his face.\\n\\n\"W -- what?\"\\n\\nHarry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the floor was\\nshaking -- the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come\\nback on. He seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor. Ron and\\nHermione were kneeling next to him, and above them he could see Neville\\nand Professor Lupin watching. Harry felt very sick; when he put up his\\nhand to push his glasses back on, he felt cold sweat on his face.\\n\\nRon and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat.\\n\\n\"Are you okay?\" Ron asked nervously.\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The hooded creature\\nhad vanished. \"What happened? Where\\'s that -- that thing? Who screamed?\"\\n\\n\"No one screamed,\" said Ron, more nervously still.\\n\\nHarry looked around the bright compartment. Ginny and Neville looked\\nback at him, both very pale.\\n\\n\"But I heard screaming --\"\\n\\nA loud snap made them all jump. Professor Lupin was breaking an enormous\\nslab of chocolate into pieces.\\n\\n\"Here,\" he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. \"Eat\\nit. It\\'ll help.\"\\n\\nHarry took the chocolate but didn\\'t eat it.\\n\\n\"What was that thing?\" he asked Lupin.\\n\\n\"A dementor,\" said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else.\\n\"One of the dementors of Azkaban.\"\\n\\nEveryone stared at him. Professor Lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate\\nwrapper and put it in his pocket.\\n\\n\"Eat,\" he repeated. \"It\\'ll help. I need to speak to the driver, excuse\\nme...\\n\\nHe strolled past Harry and disappeared into the corridor.\\n\\n\"Are you sure you\\'re okay, Harry?\" said Hermione, watching Harry\\nanxiously.\\n\\n\"I Don\\'t get it.... What happened?\" said Harry, wiping more sweat off\\nhis face.\\n\\n\"Well -- that thing -- the dementor -- stood there and looked around (I\\nmean, I think it did, I couldn\\'t see its face) -- and you -- you\\n\\n\"I thought you were having a fit or something,\" said Ron, who still\\nlooked scared. \"You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and\\nstarted twitching -- 11\\n\\n\"And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor,\\nand pulled out his wand,\" said Hermione, \"and he said, \\'None of us is\\nhiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.\\' But the dementor didn\\'t move,\\nso Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at\\nit, and it turned around and sort of glided away.... \"\\n\\n\"It was horrible,\" said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. \"Did YOU\\nfeel how cold it got when it came in?\"\\n\\nI felt weird,\" said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. \"Like I\\'d\\nnever be cheerful again....\"\\n\\nGinny, who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as Harry\\nfelt, gave a small sob; Hermione went over and put a comforting arm\\naround her.\\n\\n\"But didn\\'t any of you -- fall off your seats?\" said Harry awkwardly.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ron, looking anxiously at Harry again. \"Ginny was shaking\\nlike mad, though....\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t understand. He felt weak and shivery, as though he were\\nrecovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings of shame.\\nWhy had he gone to pieces like that, when no one else had?\\n\\nProfessor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, looked around,\\nand said, with a small smile, \"I haven\\'t poisoned that chocolate, you\\nknow....\"\\n\\nHarry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly\\nto the tips of his fingers and toes.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Are you\\nall right, Harry?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name.\\n\\n\"Fine,\" he muttered, embarrassed.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t talk much during the remainder of the journey. At long last,\\nthe train stopped at Hogsmeade station, and there was a great scramble\\nto get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and Neville\\'s pet toad croaked\\nloudly from under his hat. It was freezing on the tiny platform; rain\\nwas driving down in icy sheets.\\n\\n\"Firs\\' years this way!\" called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of Hagrid at the other end\\nof the platform, beckoning the terrified-looking new students forward\\nfor their traditional journey across the lake.\\n\\n\"All right, you three?\" Hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd. They\\nwaved at him, but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of\\npeople around them was shunting them away along the platform. Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and\\nout onto a rough mud track, where at least a hundred stagecoaches\\nawaited the remaining students, each pulled, Harry could only assume, by\\nan invisible horse, because when they climbed inside and shut the door,\\nthe coach set off all by itself, bumping and swaying in procession.\\n\\nThe coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better since the\\nchocolate, but still weak. Ron and Hermione kept looking at him\\nsideways, as though frightened he might collapse again.\\n\\nAs the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron\\ngates, flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars,\\n\\nHarry saw two more towering, hooded dementors, standing guard on either\\nside. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned\\nback into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the\\ngates. The carriage picked up speed on the long, sloping drive up to the\\ncastle; Hermione was leaning out of the tiny window, watching the many\\nturrets and towers draw nearer. At last, the carriage swayed to a halt,\\nand Hermione and Ron got out.\\n\\nAs Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in his ear.\\n\\n\"You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottorn telling the truth? You actualy\\nfainted?\"\\n\\nMalfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry\\'s way up the stone steps to\\nthe castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously.\\n\"Shove off, Malfoy,\" said Ron, whose jaw was clenched.\\n\\n\"Did you faint as well, Weasley?\" said Malfoy loudly. \"Did the scary old\\ndementor frighten you too, Weasley?\"\\n\\n\"Is there a problem?\" said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just gotten\\nout of the next carriage.\\n\\nMalfoy gave Professor Lupin an insolent stare, which took in the patches\\non his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint of sarcasm\\nin his voice, he said, \"Oh, no -- er -- Professor,\" then he smirked at\\nCrabbe and Goyle and led them up the steps into the castle.\\n\\nHermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the three of\\nthem joined the crowd swarming up the steps, through the giant oak front\\ndoors, into the cavernous entrance hall, which was lit with flaming\\ntorches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper\\nfloors.\\n\\nThe door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry followed the\\ncrowd toward it, but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling, which\\nwas black and cloudy tonight, when a voice called, \"Potter! Granger! I\\nwant to see you both!\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione turned around, surprised. Professor McGonagall,\\nTransfiguration teacher and head of Gryffindor House, was calling over\\nthe heads of the crowd. She was a sternlooking witch who wore her hair\\nin a tight bun; her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles. Harry\\nfought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor\\nMcGonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something\\nwrong.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in MY office,\"\\nshe told them. \"Move along there, Weasley.\"\\n\\nRon stared as Professor McGonagall ushered Harry and Hermione away from\\nthe chattering crowd; they accompanied her across the entrance hall, up\\nthe marble staircase, and along a corridor.\\n\\nOnce they were in her office, a small room with a large, welcoming fire,\\nProfessor McGonagall motioned Harry and Hermione to sit down. She\\nsettled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, \"Professor Lupin sent\\nan owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train, Potter.\"\\n\\nBefore Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and Madam\\nPomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in.\\n\\nHarry felt himself going red in the face. It was bad enough that he\\'d\\npassed out, or whatever he had done, without everyone making all this\\nfuss.\\n\\n\"I\\'m fine,\" he said, \"I don\\'t need anything\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s you, is it?\" said Madam Pomfrey, ignoring this and bending\\ndown to stare closely at him. \"I suppose you\\'ve been doing something\\ndangerous again?\"\\n\\n\"It was a dementor, Poppy,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n\\nThey exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked disapprovingly.\\n\\n\"Setting dementors around a school, she muttered, pushing back Harry\\'s\\nhair and feeling his forehead. \"He won\\'t be the last one who collapses.\\nYes, he\\'s all clammy. Terrible things, they are, and the effect they\\nhave on people who are already delicate\\n\\n\"I\\'m not delicate!\" said Harry crossly.\\n\\n\"Of course you\\'re not,\" said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, now taking\\nhis pulse.\\n\\n\"What does he need?\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"Bed rest?\\nShould he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m fine!\" said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco Malfoy\\nwould say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture.\\n\\n\"Well, he should have some chocolate, at the very least,\" said Madam\\nPomfrey, who was now trying to peer into Harry\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve already had some,\" said Harry. \"Professor Lupin gave me some. He\\ngave it to all of us.\"\\n\\n\"Did he, now?\" said Madam Pomfrey approvingly. \"So we\\'ve finally got a\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his remedies?\"\\n\\n\"Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?\" Professor McGonagall said\\nsharply.\\n\\n\"Yes, \"said Harry.\\n\\n\"Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with Miss\\nGranger about her course schedule, then we can go down to the feast\\ntogether.\"\\n\\nHarry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who left for the\\nhospital wing, muttering to herself He had to wait only a few minutes;\\nthen Hermione emerged looking very happy about something, followed by\\nProfessor McGonagall, and the three of them made their way back down the\\nmarble staircase to the Great Hall.\\n\\nIt was a sea of pointed black hats; each of the long House tables was\\nlined with students, their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of\\ncandles, which were floating over the tables in midair. Professor\\nFlitwick, who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair, was\\ncarrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out of the hall.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Hermione softly, \"we\\'ve missed the Sorting!\"\\n\\nNew students at Hogwarts were sorted into Houses by trying on the\\nsorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best suited to\\n(Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Professor McGonagall\\nstrode off toward her empty seat at the staff table, and Harry and\\nHermione set off in the other direction, as quietly as possible, toward\\nthe Gryffindor table. People looked around at them as they passed along\\nthe back of the hall, and a few of them pointed at Harry. Had the story\\nof his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast?\\n\\nHe and Hermione sat down on either side of Ron, who had saved them\\nseats.\\n\\n\"What was all that about?\" he muttered to Harry.\\n\\nHarry started to explain in a whisper, but at that moment the headmaster\\nstood up to speak, and he broke off.\\n\\nProfessor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impression of\\ngreat energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard,\\nhalf-moon spectacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He was often\\ndescribed as the greatest wizard of the age, but that wasn\\'t why Harry\\nrespected him. You couldn\\'t help trusting Albus Dumbledore, and as Harry\\nwatched him beaming around at the students, he felt really calm for the\\nfirst time since the dementor had entered the train compartment.\\n\\n\"Welcome!\" said Dumbledore, the candlelight shimmering on his beard.\\n\"Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say to you\\nall, and as one of them is very serious, I think it best to get it out\\nof the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast....\"\\n\\nDumbledore cleared his throat and continued, \"As you will all be aware\\nafter their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is presently\\nplaying host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who are here on\\nMinistry of Magic business.\"\\n\\nHe paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said about\\nDumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school.\\n\\n\"They are stationed at every entrance to the grounds,\" Dumbledore\\ncontinued, \"and while they are with us, I must make it plain that nobody\\nis to leave school without permission. Dementors are not to be fooled by\\ntricks or disguises -- or even Invisibility Cloaks,\" he added blandly,\\nand Harry and Ron glanced at each other. \"It is not in the nature of a\\ndementor to understand pleading or excuses. I therefore warn each and\\nevery one of you to give them no reason to harm you. I look to the\\nprefects, and our new Head Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student\\nruns afoul of the dementors,\" he said.\\n\\nPercy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out his chest\\nagain and stared around impressively. Dumbledore paused again; he looked\\nvery seriously around the hall, and nobody moved or made a sound.\\n\\n\"On a happier note,\" he continued, I am pleased to welcome two new\\nteachers to our ranks this year.\\n\\n\"First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post of\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\"\\n\\nThere was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only those who\\nhad been in the compartment on the train with Professor Lupin clapped\\nhard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin looked particularly shabby next\\nto all the other teachers in their best robes.\\n\\n\"Look at Snape!\" Ron hissed in Harry\\'s ear.\\n\\nProfessor Snape, the Potions master, was staring along the staff table\\nat Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape ,anted the\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts job, but even Harry, who hated Snape, was\\nstartled at the expression twisting his thin, sallow face. it was beyond\\nanger: it was loathing. Harry knew that expression only too well; it was\\nthe look Snape wore every time he set eyes on Harry.\\n\\n\"As to our second new appointment,\" Dumbledore continued as the lukewarm\\napplause for Professor Lupin died away. \"Well, I am sorry to tell you\\nthat Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical Creatures teacher,\\nretired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his\\nremaining limbs. However, I am delighted to say that his place will be\\nfilled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, who has agreed to take on this\\nteaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties.\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another, stunned. Then they\\njoined in with the applause, which was tumultuous at the Gryffindor\\ntable in particular. Harry leaned forward to see Hagrid, who was\\nruby-red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands, his wide\\ngrin hidden in the tangle of his black beard.\\n\\n\"We should\\'ve known!\" Ron roared, pounding the table. \"Who else would\\nhave assigned us a biting book?\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and as\\nProfessor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that Hagrid was\\nwiping his eyes on the tablecloth.\\n\\n\"Well, I think that\\'s everything of importance,\" said Dumbledore. \"Let\\nthe feast begin!\"\\n\\nThe golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and\\ndrink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to everything he could\\nreach and began to eat.\\n\\nIt was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk, laughter, and the\\nclatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were\\neager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. They knew how\\nmuch being made a teacher would mean to him. Hagrid wasn\\'t a fully\\nqualified wizard; he had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year\\nfor a crime he had not committed. It had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\nwho had cleared Hagrid\\'s name last year.\\n\\nAt long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the\\ngolden platters, Dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all\\nto go to bed, and they got their chance.\\n\\n\"Congratulations, Hagrid!\" Hermione squealed as they reached the\\nteachers\\' table.\\n\\n\"All down ter you three,\" said Hagrid, wiping his shining face on his\\nnapkin as he looked up at them., \"Can\\' believe it... great man,\\nDumbledore... came straight down to me hut after Professor Kettleburn\\nsaid he\\'d had enough.... It\\'s what I always wanted. --\"\\n\\nOvercome with emotion, he buried his face in his napkin, and Professor\\nMcGonagall shooed them away.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up the marble\\nstaircase and, very tired now, along more corridors, UP more and more\\nstairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower\\'s large portrait of a\\nfat lady in a pink dress asked them, \"Password?\"\\n\\n\"Coming through, coming through!\" Percy called from behind the crowd.\\n\"The new password\\'s \\'Fortuna Major\\'!\"\\n\\n\"Oh no,\" said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble\\nremembering the passwords.\\n\\nThrough the portrait hole and across the common room, the girls and boys\\ndivided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed the spiral stair\\nwith no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back. They\\nreached their familiar, circular dormitory with its five four-poster\\nbeds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.\\n\\nCHAPTER SIX\\n\\nTALONS AND TEA LEAVES\\n\\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall for breakfast the\\nnext day, the first thing they saw was Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be\\nentertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny story. As\\nthey passed, Malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and\\nthere was a roar of laughter.\\n\\n\"Ignore him,\" said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. \"Just ignore\\nhim, it\\'s not worth it....\"\\n\\n\"Hey, Potter!\" shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a face\\nlike a pug. \"Potter! The dementors are coming, Potter! Woooooooooo!\"\\n\\nHarry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to George\\nWeasley.\\n\\n\"New third-year course schedules,\" said George, passing then, over.\\n\"What\\'s up with you, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Malfoy,\" said Ron, sitting down on George\\'s other side and glaring over\\nat the Slytherin table.\\n\\nGeorge looked up in time to see Malfoy pretending to faint with terror\\nagain.\\n\\n\"That little git,\" he said calmly. \"He wasn\\'t so cocky last night when\\nthe dementors were down at our end of the train. Came runing into our\\ncompartment, didn\\'t he, Fred?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly wet himself,\" said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at Malfoy.\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t too happy myself,\" said George. \"They\\'re horrible things,\\nthose dementors....\"\\n\\n\"Sort of freeze your insides, don\\'t they?\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t pass out, though, did you?\" said Harry in a low voice.\\n\\n\"Forget it, Harry,\" said George bracingly. \"Dad had to go out to Azkaban\\none time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst place he\\'d ever\\nbeen, he came back all weak and shaking.... They suck the happiness out\\nof a place, dementors. Most of the prisoners go mad in there.\"\\n\\n\"Anyway, we\\'ll see how happy Malfoy looks after our first Quidditch\\nmatch,\" said Fred. \"Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of the\\nseason, remember?\"\\n\\nThe only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a Quidditch\\nmatch, Malfoy had definitely come off worse. Feeling slightly more\\ncheerful, Harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes.\\n\\nHermione was examining her new schedule.\\n\\n\" Ooh, good, we\\'re starting some new subjects today,\" she said happily.\\nvillains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come I. scorn\\nat my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!\"\\n\\nThey watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out\\nof its scabbard and began brandishing it violently, hopping up and down\\nin rage. But the sword was too long for him; a particularly wild swing\\nmade him overbalance, and he landed facedown in the grass.\\n\\n\"Are you all right?\" said Harry, moving closer to the picture.\\n\\n\"Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!\"\\n\\nThe knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up,\\nbut the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he pulled with all\\nhis might, he couldn\\'t get it out again. Finally, he had to flop back\\ndown onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face.\\n\\n\"Listen,\" said Harry, taking advantage of the knight\\'s exhaustion,\\n\"we\\'re looking for the North Tower. You don\\'t know the way, do you?\"\\n\\n\"A quest!\" The knight\\'s rage seemed to vanish instantly. He clanked to\\nhis feet and shouted, \"Come follow me, dear friends, and we shall find\\nour goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!\"\\n\\nHe gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to mount the\\nfat pony, gave up, and cried, \"On foot then, good sirs and gentle lady!\\nOn! On!\"\\n\\nAnd he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and out of\\nsight.\\n\\nThey hurried after him along the corridor, following the sound of his\\narmor. Every now and then they spotted him running through a picture\\nahead.\\n\\n\"Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!\" yelled the knight, and\\nthey saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in\\ncrinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.\\n\\nPuffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly spiraling\\nsteps, getting dizzier and dizzier, until at last they heard the murmur\\nof voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom.\\n\\n\"Farewell!\" cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of some\\nsinister-looking monks. \"Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If ever you have\\nneed of noble heart and steely sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, we\\'ll call you,\" muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, \"if we\\never need someone mental.\"\\n\\nThey climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing, where\\nmost of the class was already assembled. There were no doors off this\\nlanding, but Ron nudged Harry and pointed at the ceiling, where there\\nwas a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it.\\n\\n\"\\'Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,\"\\' Harry read. \"How\\'re we\\nsupposed to get up there?\"\\n\\nAs though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly opened, and a\\nsilvery ladder descended right at Harry\\'s feet. Everyone got quiet.\\n\\n\"After you,\" said Ron, grinning, so Harry climbed the ladder first.\\n\\nHe emerged into the strangest-looking classroom he had ever seen. In\\nfact, it didn\\'t look like a classroom at all, more like a cross between\\nsomeone\\'s attic and an old-fashioned tea shop. At leasttwenty small,\\ncircular tables were crammed inside it, all surrounded by chintz\\narmchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson\\nlight; the curtains at the windows were all closed, and the many lamps\\nwere draped with dark red scarves. it was stiflingly warm, and the fire\\nthat was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy,\\nsickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves\\nrunning around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking\\nfeathers, stubs of candles, many packs of tattered playing cards,\\ncountless silvery crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups.\\n\\nRon appeared at Harry\\'s shoulder as the class assembled around them, all\\ntalking in whispers.\\n\\n\"Where is she?\" Ron said.\\n\\nA voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of voice.\\n\\n\"Welcome,\" it said. \"How nice to see you in the physical world at last.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect.\\nProfessor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she was\\nvery thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their\\nnatural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. Innumerable\\nchains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and her arms and hands\\nwere encrusted with bangles and rings.\\n\\n\"Sit, my children, sit,\" she said, and they all climbed awkwardly into\\narmchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves\\naround the same round table.\\n\\n\"Welcome to Divination,\" said Professor Trelawney, who had seated\\nherself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. \"My name is professor\\nTrelawney. You may not have seen me before. I find that descending too\\noften into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my Inner\\nEye.\"\\n\\nNobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. Professor\\nTrelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued, \"So you have\\nchosen to study Divination, the most difficult of all magical arts. I\\nmust warn you at the outset that if you do not have the Sight, there is\\nvery little I will be able to teach you.. Books can take you only so far\\nin this field....\"\\n\\nAt these words, both Harry and Ron glanced, grinning, at Hermione, who\\nlooked startled at the news that books wouldn\\'t be much help in this\\nsubject.\\n\\n\"Many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud\\nbangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate\\nthe veiled mysteries of the future,\" Professor Trelawney went on, her\\nenormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face. \"It is a Gift\\ngranted to few. You, boy,\" she said suddenly to Neville, who almost\\ntoppled off his pouf. \"Is your grandmother well?\"\\n\\n\"I think so,\" said Neville tremulously.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t be so sure if I were you, dear,\" said Professor Trelawney,\\nthe firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped.\\nProfessor Trelawney continued placidly. \"We will be covering the basic\\nmethods of Divination this year. The first term will be devoted to\\nreading the tea leaves. Next term we shall progress to palmistry. By the\\nway, my dear,\" she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, \"beware a red-haired\\nman.\"\\n\\nParvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her and edged\\nher chair away from him.\\n\\n\"In the second term,\" Professor Trelawney went on, \"we shall progress to\\nthe crystal ball -- if we have finished with fire omens, that is.\\nUnfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty bout of\\nflu. I myself will lose my voice. And around Easter, one of our number\\nwill leave us forever.\"\\n\\nA very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor\\nTrelawney seemed unaware of it.\\n\\n\"I wonder, dear,\" she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest and shrank\\nback in her chair, \"if you could pass me the largest silver teapot?\"\\n\\nLavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot from the\\nshelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor Trelawney.\\n\\n\"Thank you, my dear. Incidentally, that thing you are dreading -- it\\nwill happen on Friday the sixteenth of October.\"\\n\\nLavender trembled.\\n\\n\"Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from the\\nshelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, drink\\nuntil only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three times with\\nthe left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its saucer, wait for the\\nlast of the tea to drain away, then give your cup to your partner to\\nread. You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of\\nUnfogging the Future. I shall move among you, helping and instructing.\\nOh, and dear\" -- she caught Neville by the arm as he made to stand up --\\n\"after you\\'ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select\\none of the blue patterned ones? I\\'m rather attached to the pink.\"\\n\\nSure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when\\nthere was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor Trelawney swept over to\\nhim holding a dustpan and brush and said, \"One of the blue ones, then,\\ndear, if you wouldn\\'t mind... thank you. ... \"\\n\\nWhen Harry and Ron had had their teacups filled, they went back to their\\ntable and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly. They swilled the\\ndregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, then drained the\\ncups and swapped over.\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six.\\n\"What can you see in mine?\"\\n\\n\"A load of soggy brown stuff,\" said Harry. The heavily perfumed smoke in\\nthe room was making him feel sleepy and stupid.\\n\\n\"Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past the\\nmundane!\" Professor Trelawney cried through the gloom.\\n\\nHarry tried to pull himself together.\\n\\n\"Right, you\\'ve got a crooked sort of cross... \" He consulted Unfogging\\nthe Future. \"That means you\\'re going to have \\'trials and suffering\\' --\\nsorry about that -- but there\\'s a thing that could be the sun... hang\\non... that means \\'great happiness\\'... so you\\'re going to suffer but be\\nvery happy....\"\\n\\n\"You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,\" said Ron, and they both\\nhad to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their\\ndirection.\\n\\n\"My turn...\" Ron peered into Harry\\'s teacup, his forehead wrinkled with\\neffort. \"There\\'s a blob a bit like a bowler hat,\" he said. \"Maybe you\\'re\\ngoing to work for the Ministry of Magic...\\n\\nHe turned the teacup the other way up.\\n\\n\"But this way it looks more like an acorn.... What\\'s that?\" He scanned\\nhis copy of Unfogging the Future. \"\\'A windfall, unexpected gold.\\'\\nExcellent, you can lend me some... and there\\'s a thin, here,\" he turned\\nthe cup again, \"that looks like an animal... yeah, if that was its\\nhead... it looks like a hippo... no, a sheep...\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of laughter.\\n\\n\"Let me see that, my dear,\" she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping over\\nand snatching Harry\\'s cup from him. Everyone went quiet to watch.\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it\\ncounterclockwise.\\n\\n\"The falcon... my dear, you have a deadly enemy.\"\\n\\n\"But everyone knows that, \" said Hermione in a loud whisper. Professor\\nTrelawney stared at her.\\n\\n\"Well, they do,\" said Hermione. \"Everybody knows about Harry and\\nYou-Know-Who.\"\\n\\nHarry and Ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration.\\nThey had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher like that before.\\nProfessor Trelawney chose not to reply. She lowered her huge eyes to\\nHarry\\'s cup again and continued to turn it.\\n\\n\"The club... an attack. Dear, dear, this is not a happy cup....\\n\\nI thought that was a bowler hat,\" said Ron sheepishly.\\n\\n\"The skull... danger in your path, my dear....\"\\n\\nEveryone was staring, transfixed, at Professor Trelawney, who gave the\\ncup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed.\\n\\nThere was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had smashed his\\nsecond cup. Professor Trelawney sank into a vacant armchair, her\\nglittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed.\\n\\n\"My dear boy... my poor, dear boy no it is kinder not to say.. . no...\\ndon\\'t ask me....\"\\n\\n\"What is it, Professor?\" said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone had got to\\ntheir feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and Ron\\'s table,\\npressing close to Professor Trelawney\\'s chair to get a\\n\\ngood look at Harry\\'s cup.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" Professor Trelawney\\'s huge eyes opened dramatically,\\n\\n\"You have the Grim.\"\\n\\n\"The what?\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe could tell that he wasn\\'t the only one who didn\\'t understand; Dean\\nThomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puzzled, but nearly\\neverybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror.\\n\\n\"The Grim, my dear, the Grim!\" cried Professor Trelawney, who looked\\nshocked that Harry hadn\\'t understood. \"The giant, spectral dog that\\nhaunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen -- the worst omen -- of\\ndeath!\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens in\\nFlourish and Blotts -the dog in the shadows of Magnolia Crescent...\\nLavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth too. Everyone was looking\\nat Harry, everyone except Hermione, who had gotten up and moved around\\nto the back of Professor Trelawney\\'s chair.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think it looks like a Grim,\" she said flatly.\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little\\naura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the\\nfuture.\" Seamus Finnigan was tilting his head from side to side.\\n\\n\"It looks like a Grim if you do this,\" he said, with his eyes almost\\nshut, \"but it looks more like a donkey from here,\" he said, leaning to\\nthe left.\\n\\n\"When you\\'ve all finished deciding whether I\\'m going to die Or not!\"\\nsaid Harry, taking even himself by surprise. Now nobody seemed to want\\nto look at him.\\n\\n\"I think we will leave the lesson here for today,\" said Professor\\nTrelawney in her mistiest voice. \"Yes... please pack away your\\nthings....\"\\n\\nSilently the class took their teacups back to Professor Trelawney,\\npacked away their books, and closed their bags. Even Ron was avoiding\\nHarry\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"Until we meet again,\" said Professor Trelawney faintly, \"fair fortune\\nbe yours. Oh, and dear\" -- she pointed at Neville -- \"you\\'ll be late\\nnext time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up.\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney\\'s ladder and the\\nwinding stair in silence, then set off for Professor McGonagall\\'s\\nTransfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her classroom that,\\nearly as they had left Divination, they were only just in time.\\n\\nHarry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he\\nwere sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept\\nshooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at\\nany moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them\\nabout Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and\\nwasn\\'t even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes\\ninto a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.\\n\\n\"Really, what has got into you all today?\" said Professor McGonagall,\\nturning back into herself with a faint pop, and staring around at them\\nall. \"Not that it matters, but that\\'s the first time my transformation\\'s\\nnot got applause from a class.\"\\n\\nEverybody\\'s heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. Then\\nHermione raised her hand.\\n\\n\"Please, Professor, we\\'ve just had our first Divination class, and we\\nwere reading the tea leaves, and --\"\\n\\n\"Ah, of course,\" said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning.\\n\\n\"There is no need to say any more, Miss Granger. Tell me, which of you\\nwill be dying this year?\"\\n\\nEveryone stared at her.\\n\\n\"Me,\" said Harry, finally.\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Professor McGonagall, fixing Harry with her beady eyes.\\n\"Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the\\ndeath of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of\\nthem has died yet. Seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a\\nnew class. If it were not for the fact that I never speak ill of my\\ncolleagues --\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils had gone\\nwhite. She went on, more calmly, \"Divination is one of the most\\nimprecise branches of magic. I shall not conceal from you that I have\\nvery little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor\\nTrelawney --\"\\n\\nShe stopped again, and then said, in a very matter-of-fact tone, \"You\\nlook in excellent health to me, Potter, so you will excuse me if I don\\'t\\nlet you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you need not\\nhand it in.\"\\n\\nHermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel scared\\nof a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling\\nperfume of Professor Trelawney\\'s classroom. Not everyone was convinced,\\nhowever. Ron still looked worried, and Lavender whispered, \"But what\\nabout Neville\\'s cup?\"\\n\\nWhen the Transfiguration class had finished, they joined the crowd\\nthundering toward the Great Hall for lunch.\\n\\n\"Ron, cheer up,\" said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward him. \"You\\nheard what Professor McGonagall said.\"\\n\\nRon spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but didn\\'t start.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" he said, in a low, serious voice, \"You haven\\'t seen a great\\nblack dog anywhere, have you?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I have,\" said Harry. \"I saw one the night I left the Dursleys\\'. \"\\n\\nRon let his fork fall with a clatter.\\n\\n\"Probably a stray,\" said Hermione calmly.\\n\\nRon looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad.\\n\\n\"Hermione, if Harry\\'s seen a Grim, that\\'s -- that\\'s bad,\" he said. \"My\\n-- my uncle Bilius saw one and -- and he died twenty-four hours later!\"\\n\\n\"Coincidence,\" said Hermione airily, pouring herself some pumpkin juice.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about!\" said Ron, starting to get\\nangry. \"Grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards!\"\\n\\n\"There you are, then,\" said Hermione in a superior tone. \"They see the\\nGrim and die of fright. The Grim\\'s not an omen, it\\'s the cause of death!\\nAnd Harry\\'s still with us because he\\'s not stupid enough to see one and\\nthink, right, well, I\\'d better kick the bucket then!\"\\n\\nRon mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, took out her new\\nArithmancy book, and propped it open against the juice jug.\\n\\n\"I think Divination seems very woolly,\" she said, searching for her\\npage. \"A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.\"\\n\\n\"There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!\" said Ron hotly.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry it was a\\nsheep,\" said Hermione coolly.\\n\\n\"Professor Trelawney said you didn\\'t have the right aura! You just don\\'t\\nlike being bad at something for a change!\"\\n\\nHe had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy book down on the\\ntable so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere.\\n\\n\"If being good at Divination means I have to pretend to see death omens\\nin a lump of tea leaves, I\\'m not sure I\\'ll be studying it much longer!\\nThat lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my Arithmancy class!\"\\n\\nShe snatched up her bag and stalked away.\\n\\nRon frowned after her.\\n\\n\"What\\'s she talking about?\" he said to Harry. \"She hasn\\'t been to an\\nArithmancy class yet.\"\\n\\nHarry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday\\'s rain\\nhad cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was springy\\nand damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care of Magical\\nCreatures class.\\n\\nRon and Hermione weren\\'t speaking to each other. Harry walked beside\\nthem in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to Hagrid\\'s hut on\\nthe edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when he spotted three\\nonly-too- familiar backs ahead of them that he realized they must be\\nhaving these lessons with the Slytherins. Malfoy was talking animatedly\\nto Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. Harry was quite sure he knew\\nwhat they were talking about.\\n\\nHagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood in his\\nmoleskin overcoat, with Fang the boarhound at his heels, looking\\nimpatient to start.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon, now, get a move on!\" he called as the class approached. \"Got a\\nreal treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin\\' up! Everyone here? Right,\\nfollow me!\"\\n\\nFor one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to lead them\\ninto the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to\\nlast him a lifetime. However, Hagrid strolled off around the edge of the\\ntrees, and five minutes later, they found themselves outside a kind of\\npaddock. There was nothing in there.\\n\\n\"Everyone gather \\'round the fence here!\" he called. \"That\\'s it -- make\\nsure yeh can see -- now, firs\\' thing yeh\\'ll want ter do is open yer\\nbooks --\"\\n\\n\"How?\" said the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy.\\n\\n\"Eh?\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"How do we open our books?\" Malfoy repeated. He took out his copy of The\\nMonster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope.\\nOther people took theirs out too; some, like Harry, had belted their\\nbook shut; others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them\\ntogether with binder clips.\\n\\n\"Hasn\\' -- hasn\\' anyone bin able ter open their books?\" said Hagrid,\\nlooking crestfallen.\\n\\nThe class all shook their heads.\\n\\n\"Yeh\\'ve got ter stroke \\'em,\" said Hagrid, as though this was the most\\nobvious thing in the world. \"Look --\"\\n\\nHe took Hermione\\'s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that bound it. The\\nbook tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine,\\nand the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand.\\n\\n\"Oh, how silly we\\'ve all been!\" Malfoy sneered. \"We should have stroked\\nthem! why didn\\'t we guess!\"\\n\\n\"I -- I thought they were funny,\" Hagrid said uncertainly to Hermione.\\n\\n\"Oh, tremendously funny!\" said Malfoy. \"Really witty, giving us books\\nthat try and rip our hands off!\"\\n\\n\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking downcast and\\nHarry wanted Hagrid\\'s first lesson to be a success.\\n\\n\"Righ\\' then,\" said Hagrid, who seemed to have lost his thread, \"so -- so\\nyeh\\'ve got yer books an\\' -- an\\' - - now yeh need the Magical Creatures.\\nYeah. So I\\'ll go an\\' get \\'em. Hang on... \"\\n\\nHe strode away from them into the forest and out of sight.\\n\\n\"God, this place is going to the dogs,\" said Malfoy loudly. \"That oaf\\nteaching classes, my father\\'ll have a fit when I tell him\\n\\n\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" Harry repeated.\\n\\n\"Careful, Potter, there\\'s a dementor behind you\\n\\n\"Oooooooh!\" squealed Lavender Brown, pointing toward the opposite side\\nof the paddock.\\n\\nTrotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures Harry\\nhad ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but\\nthe front legs, wings, and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles, with\\ncruel, steel-colored beaks and large, brilliantly, orange eyes. The\\ntalons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking.\\nEach of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck, which was\\nattached to a long chain, and the ends of all of these were held in the\\nvast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into the paddock behind the\\ncreatures.\\n\\n\"Gee up, there!\" he roared, shaking the chains and urging the creatures\\ntoward the fence where the class stood. Everyone drew back slightly as\\nHagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence.\\n\\n\"Hippogriffs!\" Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. \"Beau\\'iful,\\naren\\' they?\"\\n\\nHarry could sort of see what Hagrid meant. Once you got over the first\\nshock of seeing something that was, half horse, half bird, you started\\nto appreciate the hippogriffs\\' gleaming coats, changing smoothly from\\nfeather to hair, each of them a different color: stormy gray, bronze,\\npinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.\\n\\n\"So,\" said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming around, \"if\\nyeh wan\\' ter come a bit nearer --\"\\n\\nNo one seemed to want to. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, approached\\nthe fence cautiously.\\n\\n\"Now, firs\\' thing yeh gotta know abou\\' hippogriffs is, they\\'re proud,\"\\nsaid Hagrid. \"Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don\\'t never insult one,\\n\\'cause it might be the last thing yeh do.\"\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren\\'t listening; they were talking in an\\nundertone and Harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to\\ndisrupt the lesson.\\n\\n\"Yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs\\' move,\" Hagrid\\ncontinued. \"It\\'s polite, see? Yeh walk toward him, and yeh bow, an\\' yeh\\nwait. If he bows back, yeh\\'re allowed ter touch him. If he doesn\\' bow,\\nthen get away from him sharpish, \\'cause those talons hurt.\\n\\n\"Right -- who wants ter go first?\"\\n\\nMost of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione had misgivings. The hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads\\nand flexing their powerful wings; they didn\\'t seem to like being\\ntethered like this.\\n\\n\"No one?\" said Hagrid, with a pleading look.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do it,\" said Harry.\\n\\nThere was an intake of breath from behind him, and both Lavender and\\nParvati whispered, \"Oooh, no, Harry, remember your tea leaves!\"\\n\\nHarry ignored them. He climbed over the paddock fence.\\n\\n\"Good man, Harry!\" roared Hagrid. \"Right then -- let\\'s see how yeh get\\non with Buckbeak.\"\\n\\nHe untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away from its\\nfellows, and slipped off its leather collar. The class on the other side\\nof the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy\\'s eyes were\\nnarrowed maliciously.\\n\\n\"Easy) now, Harry,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Yeh\\'ve got eye contact, now\\ntry not ter blink.... Hippogriffs don\\' trust yeh if yeh blink too\\nmuch....\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s eyes immediately began to water, but he didn\\'t shut thern.\\nBuckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring at Harry with\\none fierce orange eye. \"Tha\\'s it,\" said Hagrid. \"Tha\\'s it, Harry... now,\\nbow.\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t feel much like exposing the back of his neck to Buckbeak,\\nbut he did as he was told. He gave a short bow and then looked up.\\n\\nThe hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him. It didn\\'t move.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Hagrid, sounding worried. \"Right -- back away, now, Harry,\\neasy does it\\n\\nBut then, to Harry\\'s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly bent its\\nscaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable bow.\\n\\n\"Well done, Harry!\" said Hagrid, ecstatic. \"Right -- yeh can touch him!\\nPat his beak, go on!\"\\n\\nFeeling that a better reward would have been to back away, Harry moved\\nslowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it. He patted the\\nbeak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily, as though\\nenjoying it.\\n\\nThe class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle,\\nwho were looking deeply disappointed.\\n\\n\"Righ\\' then, Harry,\" said Hagrid. \"I reckon he might\\' let yeh ride him!\"\\n\\nThis was more than Harry had bargained for. He was used to a broomstick;\\nbut he wasn\\'t sure a hippogriff would be quite the same.\\n\\n\"Yeh climb up there, jus\\' behind the wing joint,\" said Hagrid, \"an\\' mind\\nyeh don\\' pull any of his feathers out, he won\\' like that....\"\\n\\nHarry put his foot on the top of Buckbeaks wing and hoisted himself onto\\nits back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn\\'t sure where to hold on;\\neverything in front of him was covered with feathers.\\n\\n\"Go on, then\\'\" roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters.\\n\\nWithout warning, twelve-foot wings flapped open on either side of Harry,\\nhe just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was\\nsoaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, and Harry knew which\\none he preferred; the hippogriff\\'s wings beat uncomfortably on either\\nside of him, catching him under his legs and making him feel he was\\nabout to be thrown off; the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers\\nand he didn\\'t dare get a stronger grip; instead of the smooth action of\\nhis Nimbus Two Thousand, he now felt himself rocking backward and\\nforward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its\\nwings.\\n\\nBuckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the\\nground; this was the bit Harry had been dreading; he leaned back as the\\nsmooth neck lowered, feeling he was going to slip off over the beak,\\nthen felt a heavy thud as the four ill-assorted feet hit the ground. He\\njust managed to hold on and push himself straight again.\\n\\n\"Good work, Harry!\" roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, Crabbe, and\\nGoyle cheered. \"Okay, who else wants a go?\"\\n\\nEmboldened by Harry\\'s success, the rest of the class climbed cautiously\\ninto the paddock. Hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one, and soon\\npeople were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. Neville ran\\nrepeatedly backward from his, which didn\\'t seem to want to bend its\\nknees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chestnut, while Harry watched.\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had bowed to\\nMalfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking disdainful.\\n\\n\"This is very easy,\" Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to, hear him.\\n\"I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it.... I bet you\\'re not\\ndangerous at all, are you?\" he said to the hippogriff. \"Are you, you\\ngreat ugly brute?\"\\n\\nIt happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a highpitched\\nscream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak back into his\\ncollar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled in the grass,\\nblood blossoming over his robes.\\n\\n\"I\\'m dying!\" Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. \"I\\'m dying, look at\\nme! It\\'s killed me!\"\\n\\n\"Yer not dyin\\'!\" said Hagrid, who had gone very white. \"Someone help me\\n-- gotta get him outta here --\"\\n\\nHermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy easily. As\\nthey passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on Malfoy\\'s arm;\\nblood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward\\nthe castle.\\n\\nVery shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a walk. The\\nSlytherins were all shouting about Hagrid.\\n\\n\"They should fire him straight away!\" said Pansy Parkinson, who was in\\ntears.\\n\\n\"It was Malfoy\\'s fault!\" snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and Goyle flexed\\ntheir muscles threateningly.\\n\\nThey all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to see if he\\'s okay!\" said Pansy, and they all watched her\\nrun up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering about\\nHagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room;\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs to Gryffindor Tower.\\n\\n\"You think he\\'ll be all right?\" said Hermione nervously.\\n\\n\"Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second,\" said\\nHarry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse.\\n\\n\"That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid\\'s first class, though,\\nwasn\\'t it?\" said Ron, looking worried. \"Trust Malfoy to mess things up\\nfor him....\"\\n\\nThey were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinnertime, hoping\\nto see Hagrid, but he wasn\\'t there.\\n\\n\"They wouldn\\'t fire him, would they?\" said Hermione anxiously, not\\ntouching her steak-and- kidney pudding.\\n\\n\"They\\'d better not,\" said Ron, who wasn\\'t eating either.\\n\\nHarry was watching the Slytherin table. A large group including Crabbe\\nand Goyle was huddled together, deep in conversation. Harry was sure\\nthey were cooking up their own version of how Malfoy had been injured.\\n\\n\"Well, you can\\'t say it wasn\\'t an interesting first day back,\" said Ron\\ngloomily.\\n\\nThey went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after dinner and\\ntried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had given them, but all\\nthree of them kept breaking off and glancing Out of the tower window.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a light on in Hagrid\\'s window,\" Harry said suddenly.\\n\\nRon looked at his watch.\\n\\n\"If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It\\'s still quite early...\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know,\" Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance at him.\\n\\n\"I\\'m allowed to walk across the grounds, \" he said Pointedly. \"Sirius\\nBlack hasn\\'t got past the dementors yet, has he?\"\\n\\nSo they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole, glad\\nto meet nobody on their way to the front doors, as they weren\\'t entirely\\nsure they were supposed to be out.\\n\\nThe grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. When\\nthey reached Hagrid\\'s hut, they knocked, and a voice growled, \"C\\'min.\"\\n\\nHagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table; his\\nboarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid\\'s lap. One look told them that\\nHagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big\\nas a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty\\ngetting them into focus.\\n\\n\"\\'Spect it\\'s a record,\" he said thickly, when he recognized them. \"Don\\'\\nreckon they\\'ve ever had a teacher who lasted on\\'y a day before.\"\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t been fired, Hagrid!\" gasped Hermione.\\n\\n\"Not yet,\" said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever was in\\nthe tankard. \"But\\'s only a matter o\\' time, i\\' n\\'t it, after Malfoy...\"\\n\\n\"How is he?\" said Ron as they all sat down. \"It wasn\\'t serious, was it?\"\\n\\n\"Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,\" said Hagrid dully, \"but he\\'s\\nsayin\\' it\\'s still agony... covered in bandages... moanin\\'..\\n\\n\"He\\'s faking it, \" said Harry at once. \"Madam Pomfrey can mend anything.\\nShe regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk it for all it\\'s\\nworth.\"\\n\\n\"School gov\\'nors have bin told, o\\' course,\" said Hagrid miseribly. \"They\\nreckon I started too big. Shoulda left hippogriffs fer later... done\\nflobberworms or summat.... Jus\\' thought itdmake a good firs\\' lessons all\\nmy fault....\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s all Malfoy\\'s fault, Hagrid!\" said Hermione earnestly.\\n\\n\"We\\'re witnesses,\" said Harry. \"You said hippogriffs attack if you\\ninsult them. It\\'s Malfoy\\'s problem that he wasn\\'t listening. We\\'ll tell\\nDumbledore what really happened.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, don\\'t worry, Hagrid, we\\'ll back you up,\" said Ron.\\n\\nTears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid\\'s beetle-black eyes.\\nHe grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a bone-breaking hug.\\n\\n\"I think you\\'ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,\" said Hermione firmly. She\\ntook the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it.\\n\\n\"At, maybe she\\'s right,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Harry and Ron, who\\nboth staggered away, rubbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved himself out of\\nhis chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. They heard a loud\\nsplash.\\n\\n\"What\\'s he done?\" said Harry nervously as Hermione came back in with the\\nempty tankard.\\n\\n\"Stuck his head in the water barrel,\" said Hermione, putting the tankard\\naway.\\n\\nHagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping the water\\nout of his eyes.\\n\\n\"That\\'s better,\" he said, shaking his head like a dog and drenching them\\nall. \"Listen, it was good of yeh ter come an\\' see me, I really --\\n\\nHagrid stopped dead, staring at Harry as though he\\'d only just realized\\nhe was there.\\n\\n\"WHAT D\\'YEH THINK YOU\\'RE DOIN\\', EH?\" he roared, so suddenly that they\\njumped a foot in the air. \"YEH\\'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN\\' AROUND AFTER DARK,\\nHARRY! AN, YOU TWO! LETTIN\\' HIM!\"\\n\\nHagrid strode over to Harry, grabbed his arm, and pulled him to the\\ndoor.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon!\" Hagrid said angrily. \"I\\'m takin\\' yer all back up ter school,\\nan\\' don\\' let me catch yeh walkin\\' down ter see me after dark again. I\\'m\\nnot worth that!\"\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVEN\\n\\nTHE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE\\n\\nMalfoy didn\\'t reappear in classes until late on Thursday morning, when\\nthe Slytherins and Gryffindors were halfway through double Potions. He\\nswaggered into the dungeon, his right arm covered in bandages and bound\\nup in a sling, acting, in Harry\\'s opinion, as though he were the heroic\\nsurvivor of some dreadful battle.\\n\\n\"How is it, Draco?\" simpered Pansy Parkinson. \"Does it hurt much?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But Harry saw\\nhim wink at Crabbe and Goyle when Pansy had looked away.\\n\\n\"Settle down, settle down,\" said Professor Snape idly.\\n\\nHarry and Ron scowled at each other; Snape wouldn\\'t have said \"settle\\ndown\" if they\\'d walked in late, he\\'d have given them detention. But\\nMalfoy had always been able to get away with anything in Snape\\'s\\nclasses; Snape was head of Slytherin House, and generality favored his\\nown students above all others.\\n\\nThey were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. Malfoy set up\\nhis cauldron right next to Harry and Ron, so that they were preparing\\ntheir ingredients on the same table.\\n\\n\"Sir,\" Malfoy called, \"sir, I\\'ll need help cutting up these daisy roots,\\nbecause of my arm --\"\\n\\n\"Weasley, cut up Malfoy\\'s roots for him,\" said Snape without looking up.\\n\\nRon went brick red.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing wrong with your arm,\" he hissed at Malfoy.\\n\\nMalfoy smirked across the table.\\n\\n\"Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.\"\\n\\nRon seized his knife, pulled Malfoy\\'s roots toward him, and began to\\nchop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes.\\n\\n\"Professor,\" drawled Malfoy, \"Weasley\\'s mutilating my roots, sit.\"\\n\\nSnape approached their table, stared down his hooked nose at the roots,\\nthen gave Ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long, greasy black\\nhair.\\n\\n\"Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.\"\\n\\n\"But, sit --!\"\\n\\nRon had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own\\nroots into exactly equal pieces.\\n\\n\"Now,\" said Snape in his most dangerous voice.\\n\\nRon shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table a, Malfoy,\\nthen took up the knife again.\\n\\n\"And, sir, I\\'ll need this shrivelfig skinned,\" said Malfoy, his voice\\nfull of malicious laughter.\\n\\n\"Potter, you can skin Malfoy\\'s shrivelfig,\" said Snape, giving Harry the\\nlook of loathing he always reserved just for him.\\n\\nHarry took Malfoy\\'s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the damage\\nto the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as\\nhe could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy without speaking.\\nMalfoy was smirking more broadly than ever.\\n\\n\"Seen your pal Hagrid lately?\" he asked them quietly.\\n\\n\"None of your business,\" said Ron jerkily, without looking up.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid he won\\'t be a teacher much longer,\" said Malfoy in a tone of\\nmock sorrow. \"Father\\'s not very happy about my injury --\"\\n\\n\"Keep talking, Malfoy, and I\\'ll give you a real injury,\" snarled Ron.\\n\\n\"- he\\'s complained to the school governors. And to the Ministry of\\nMagic. Father\\'s got a lot of influence, you know. And a lasting injury\\nlike this\" -- he gave a huge, fake sigh -- \"who knows if my arm\\'ll ever\\nbe the same again?\"\\n\\n\"So that\\'s why you\\'re putting it on,\" said Harry, accidentally beheading\\na dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger. \"To try to get\\nHagrid fired.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, \"partly, Potter.\\nBut there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpillars for\\nme.\"\\n\\nA few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly went to\\npieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear\\nof Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His potion, which was\\nsupposed to be a bright, acid green, had turned --\\n\\n\"Orange, Longbottom,\" said Snape, ladling some up and allowing to splash\\nback into the cauldron, so that everyone could see.\\n\\n\"Orange. Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of\\nyours? Didn\\'t you hear me say, quite clearly, that only one -tat spleen\\nwas needed? Didn\\'t I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would\\nsuffice? What do I have to do to make you understand, Longbottom?\"\\n\\nNeville was pink and trembling. He looked as though he was on the verge\\nof tears.\\n\\n\"Please, sir,\" said Hermione, \"please, I could help Neville put it right\\n--\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,\" said Snape\\ncoldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. \"Longbottom, at the end of\\nthis lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see\\nwhat happens. Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly.\"\\n\\nSnape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear.\\n\\n\"Help me!\" he moaned to Hermione.\\n\\n\"Hey, Harry,\" said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow Harry\\'s brass\\nscales, \"have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon\\nSirius Black\\'s been sighted.\"\\n\\n\"Where?\" said Harry and Ron quickly. On the other side of the table,\\nMalfoy looked up, listening closely.\\n\\n\"Not too far from here,\" said Seamus, who looked excited. \"It was a\\nMuggle who saw him. \\'Course, she didn\\'t really understand. The Muggles\\nthink he\\'s just an ordinary criminal, don\\'t they? So she phoned the\\ntelephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was\\ngone.\"\\n\\n\"Not too far from here... \" Ron repeated, looking significantly at\\nHarry. He turned around and saw Malfoy watching closely. \"What, Malfoy?\\nNeed something else skinned?\"\\n\\nBut Malfoy\\'s eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed Harry.\\nHe leaned across the table.\\n\\nBlack single-handed, Potter?\"\\n\\n\"Thinking Of trying to catch\\n\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s right,\" said Harry offhandedly.\\n\\nMalfoys thin mouth was curving in a mean smile.\\n\\n\"Of course, if it was me,\" he said quietly, \"I\\'d have done something\\nbefore now. I wouldn\\'t be staying in school like a good boy, I\\'d be out\\nthere looking for him.\"\\n\\n\"What are you talking about, Malfoy?\" said Ron roughly.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know, Potter?\" breathed Malfoy, his pate eyes narrowed.\\n\\n\"Know what?\"\\n\\nMalfoy let out a low, sneering laugh.\\n\\n\"Maybe you\\'d rather not risk your neck,\" he said. \"Want to leave it to\\nthe dementors, do you? But if it was me, I\\'d want revenge. I\\'d hunt him\\ndown myself.\"\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Harry angrily, but at that moment\\nSnape called, \"You should have finished adding your ingredients by now;\\nthis potion needs to stew before it can be drunk, so clear away while it\\nsimmers and then we\\'ll test Longbottom\\'s... \"\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he stirred\\nhis potion feverishly. Hermione was muttering instructions to him out of\\nthe corner of her mouth, so that Snape wouldn\\'t see. Harry and Ron\\npacked away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and\\nladles in the stone basin in the corner.\\n\\n\"What did Malfoy mean?\" Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck his hands\\nunder the icy jet that poured from the gargoyle\\'s mouth \"Why would I\\nwant revenge on Black? He hasn\\'t done anything to me -- yet.\\n\\n\"He\\'s making it up,\" said Ron savagely. \"He\\'s trying to make you do\\nsomething stupid....\"\\n\\nThe end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who was\\ncowering by his cauldron.\\n\\n\"Everyone gather \\'round,\" said Snape, his black eyes glittering, and\\nwatch what happens to Longbottom\\'s toad. If he has managed to produce a\\nShrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don\\'t doubt,\\nhe has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.\"\\n\\nThe Gryffindors watched fearfully. The Slytherins looked excited. Snape\\npicked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into\\nNeville\\'s potion, which was now green. He trickled a few drops down\\nTrevor\\'s throat.\\n\\nThere was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; then there\\nwas a small pop, and Trevor the tadpole was wriggling in Snape\\'s palm.\\n\\nThe Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled a small\\nbottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on top of Trevor,\\nand he reappeared suddenly, fully grown.\\n\\n\"Five points from Gryffindor,\" said Snape, which wiped the smiles from\\nevery face. \"I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall. Harry\\nwas still thinking about what Malfoy had said, while Ron was seething\\nabout Snape.\\n\\n\"Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right!\\n\\nWhy didn\\'t You lie, Hermione? You should\\'ve said Neville did it all by\\nhimself!\"\\n\\nHermione didn\\'t answer. Ron looked around.\\n\\n\"Where is she?\"\\n\\nHarry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watching the\\nrest of the class pass them, heading for the Great Hall and lunch.\\n\\n\"She was right behind us,\" said Ron, frowning.\\n\\nMalfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He smirked at\\nHarry and disappeared.\\n\\n\"There she is,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHermione was panting slightly, hurrying up the stairs; one hand clutched\\nher bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her\\nrobes.\\n\\n\"How did you do that?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Hermione, joining them.\\n\\n\"One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you were back at\\nthe bottom of the stairs again.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" Hermione looked slightly confused. \"Oh -- I had to go back for\\nsomething. Oh no --\"\\n\\nA seam had split on Hermione\\'s bag. Harry wasn\\'t surprised; he could see\\nthat it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books.\\n\\n\"Why are you carrying all these around with you?\" Ron asked her.\\n\\n\"You know how many subjects I\\'m taking,\" said Hermione breathlessly.\\n\"Couldn\\'t hold these for me, could you?\"\\n\\n\"But --\" Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, looking at\\nthe covers. \"You havent got any of these subjects today. It\\'s only\\nDefense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books back into\\nher bag just the same. I hope there\\'s something good for lunch, I\\'m\\nstarving,\" she added, and she marched off toward the Great Hall.\\n\\n\"D\\'you get the feeling Hermione\\'s not telling us something?Ron asked\\nHarry.\\n\\nProfessor Lupin wasn\\'t there when they arrived at his first Defense\\nAgainst the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books,\\nquills, and parchment, and were talking when he finally entered the\\nroom. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the\\nteacher\\'s desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he\\nhad on the train, as though he had had a few square meals.\\n\\n\"Good afternoon,\" he said. \"Would you please put all your books back in\\nyour bags. Today\\'s will be a practical lesson. You will need only your\\nwands.\"\\n\\nA few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books.\\nThey had never had a practical Defense Against the Dark Arts before,\\nunless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher\\nhad brought a cageful of pixies -to class and set them loose.\\n\\n\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin, when everyone was ready. \"If you\\'d\\nfollow me.\"\\n\\nPuzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Professor\\nLupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted corridor and\\naround a corner, where the first thing they saw was Peeves the\\nPoltergeist, who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the\\nnearest keyhole with chewing gum.\\n\\nPeeves didn\\'t look up until Professor Lupin was two feet away; ,hen he\\nwiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song.\\n\\n\"Loony, loopy Lupin,\" Peeves sang. \"Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, loopy\\nLupin --\"\\n\\nRude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually showed\\nsome respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor\\nLupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, he was still\\nsmiling.\\n\\n\"I\\'d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,\" he said\\npleasantly. \"Mr. Filch won\\'t be able to get in to his brooms.\"\\n\\nFilch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard who\\nwaged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. However,\\nPeeves paid no attention to Professor Lupin\\'s words, except to blow a\\nloud wet raspberry.\\n\\nProfessor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand.\\n\\n\"This is a useful little spell, he told the class over his shoulder.\\n\"Please watch closely.\"\\n\\nHe raised the wand to shoulder height, said, \"Waddiwasi! \"and pointed it\\nat Peeves.\\n\\nWith the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of the\\nkeyhole and straight down Peeves\\'s left nostril; he whirled upright and\\nzoomed away, cursing.\\n\\n\"Cool, sit!\" said Dean Thomas in amazement.\\n\\n\"Thank you, Dean,\" said Professor Lupin, putting his wand away again.\\n\"Shall we proceed?\"\\n\\nThey set off again, the class looking at shabby Professor Lupin with\\nincreased respect. He led them down a second corridor and stopped, right\\noutside the staffroom door.\\n\\n\"Inside, please,\" said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing back.\\n\\nThe staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched chairs, was\\nempty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sitting in a low\\narmchair, and he looked around as the class filed in. His eyes were\\nglittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth. As\\nProfessor Lupin came in and made to close the door behind him, Snape\\nsaid, \"Leave it open, Lupin. I\\'d rather not witness this.\"\\n\\nHe got to his feet and strode past the class, his black robes billowing\\nbehind him. At the doorway he turned on his heel and said, \"Possibly no\\none\\'s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains Neville Longbottom. I\\nwould advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless\\nMiss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear.\"\\n\\nNeville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough that he\\nbullied Neville in his own classes, let alone doing it in front of other\\nteachers.\\n\\nProfessor Lupin had raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n\"I was hoping that Neville would assist me with the first stage of the\\noperation,\" he said, \"and I am sure he will perform it admirably.\"\\n\\nNeville\\'s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape\\'s lip curled, but\\nhe left, shutting the door with a snap.\\n\\n\"Now, then,\" said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward the end of\\nthe room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers\\nkept their spare robes. As Professor Lupin went to stand next to it, the\\nwardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.\\n\\n\"Nothing to worry about,\" said Professor Lupin calmly because a few\\npeople had jumped backward in alarm. \"There\\'s a boggart in there.\"\\n\\nMost people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about.\\nNeville gave Professor Lupin a look of pure terror, and Seamus Finnigan\\neyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively.\\n\\n\"Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Wardrobes,\\nthe gap beneath beds, the cupboards under sinks -- I\\'ve even met one\\nthat had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This one moved in\\nyesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave\\nit to give my third years some practice.\\n\\n\"So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a boggart?\"\\n\\nHermione put up her hand.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a shape-shifter,\" she said. \"It can take the shape of whatever it\\nthinks will frighten us most.\"\\n\\n\"Couldn\\'t have put it better myself,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione\\nglowed. \"So the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet\\nassumed a form. He does not yet know what will frighten the person on\\nthe other side of the door. Nobody knows what a boggart looks like when\\nhe is alone, but when I let him out, he will immediately become whatever\\neach of us most fears.\\n\\n\"This means,\" said Professor Lupin, choosing to ignore Neville\\'s \\'mall\\nsputter of terror, \"that we have a huge advantage over the boggart\\nbefore we begin. Have you spotted it, Harry?\"\\n\\nTrying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, bobbing up and\\ndown on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air, was very\\noff-putting, but Harry had a go.\\n\\n\"Er -- because there are so many of us, it won\\'t know what shape it\\nshould be?\"\\n\\n\"Precisely,\" said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand down,\\nlooking a little disappointed. \"It\\'s always best to have com pany when\\nyou\\'re dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. Which should he\\nbecome, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? I once saw a boggart\\nmake that very mistake -- tried to frighten two people at once and\\nturned himself into half a slug. Not remotely frightening.\\n\\n\"The charm that repels a boggart is simple, yet it requires force of\\nmind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter.\\nWhat you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing.\\n\\n\"We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, please ...\\nRiddikulus!\"\\n\\n\"Riddikulus!\" said the class together.\\n\\n\"Good,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Very good. But that was the easy part,\\nI\\'m afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is where you\\ncome in, Neville.\"\\n\\nThe wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who walked\\nforward as though he were heading for the gallows.\\n\\n\"Right, Neville,\" said Professor Lupin. \"First things first: what would\\nyou say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?\"\\n\\nNeville\\'s lips moved, but no noise came out.\\n\\n\"didn\\'t catch that, Neville, sorry,\" said Professor Lupin cheerfully.\\n\\nNeville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone to help\\nhim, then said, in barely more than a whisper, \"Professor Snape.\"\\n\\nNearly everyone laughed. Even Neville grinned apologetically. Professor\\nLupin, however, looked thoughtful.\\n\\n\"Professor Snape... hmmm... Neville, I believe you live with your\\ngrandmother?\"\\n\\n\"Er -- yes,\" said Neville nervously. \"But -- I don\\'t want the boggart to\\nturn into her either.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, you misunderstand me,\" said Professor Lupin, now smiling. \"I\\nwonder, could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually\\nwears?\"\\n\\nNeville looked startled, but said, \"Well... always the same hat. A tall\\none with a stuffed vulture on top. And a long dress... green,\\nnormally... and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.\"\\n\\n\"And a handbag?\" prompted Professor Lupin.\\n\\n\"A big red one,\" said Neville.\\n\\n\"Right then,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Can you picture those clothes very\\nclearly, Neville? Can you see them in your mind\\'s eye?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Neville uncertainty, plainly wondering what was coming next.\\n\\n\"When the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe, Neville, and sees You, it\\nwill assume the form of Professor Snape,\" said Lupin. \"And You will\\nraise your wand -- thus -- and cry \\'Riddikulus\\' -- and concentrate hard\\non your grandmother\\'s clothes. If all goes well, Professor Boggart Snape\\nwill be forced into that vulture-topped hat, and that green dress, with\\nthat big red handbag.\"\\n\\nThere was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled more\\nviolently.\\n\\n\"If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention\\nto each of us in turn,\" said Professor Lupin. \"I would like all of you\\nto take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, and\\nimagine how you might force it to look comical....\"\\n\\nThe room went quiet. Harry thought... \\'What scared him most in the\\nworld?\\n\\nHis first thought was Lord Voldemort -- a Voldemort returned to full\\nstrength. But before he had even started to plan a possible\\ncounterattack on a boggart-Voldemort, a horrible image came floating to\\nthe surface of his mind....\\n\\nA rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black cloak ... a\\nlong, rattling breath from an unseen mouth... then a cold so penetrating\\nit felt like drowning....\\n\\nHarry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had noticed. Many\\npeople had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to himself, \"Take\\nits legs off \" Harry was sure he knew what that was about. Ron\\'s\\ngreatest fear was spiders.\\n\\n\"Everyone ready?\" said Professor Lupin.\\n\\nHarry felt a lurch of fear. He wasn\\'t ready. How could you make a\\ndementor less frightening? But he didn\\'t want to ask for more time;\\neveryone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves.\\n\\n\"Neville, we\\'re going to back away,\" said Professor Lupin. \"Let you have\\na clear field, all right? I\\'ll call the next person forward.... Everyone\\nback, now, so Neville can get a clear shot --\"\\n\\nThey all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville alone\\nbeside the wardrobe. He looked pale and frightened, but he had pushed up\\nthe sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready.\\n\\n\"On the count of three, Neville,\" said Professor Lupin, who was\\n\\npointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe. \"One two -- three\\n-- now!\"\\n\\nA jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin\\'s wand and hit the\\ndoorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and menacing, Professor\\nSnape stepped out, his eyes flashing at Neville.\\n\\nNeville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape was bearing\\ndown upon him, reaching inside his robes.\\n\\n\"R -- r -- riddikulus! \"squeaked Neville.\\n\\nThere was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wearing a\\nlong, lace-trimmed dress and a towering hat topped with a moth-eaten\\nvulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag.\\n\\nThere was a roar of laughter; the boggart paused, confused, and\\nProfessor Lupin shouted, \"Parvati! Forward!\"\\n\\nParvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. There was\\nanother crack, and where he had stood was a bloodstained, bandaged\\nmummy; its sightless face was turned to Parvati and it began to walk\\ntoward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its stiff arms rising --\\n\\n\"Riddikulus!\" cried Parvati.\\n\\nA bandage unraveled at the mummy\\'s feet; it became entangled, fell face\\nforward, and its head rolled off.\\n\\n\"Seamus!\" roared Professor Lupin.\\n\\nSeamus darted past Parvati.\\n\\nCrack! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair\\nand a skeletal, green-tinged face -- a banshee. She opened her mouth\\nwide and an unearthly sound filled the room, a long, wailing shriek that\\nmade the hair on Harry\\'s head stand on end -- \\'Riddikulus!\" shouted\\nSeamus.\\n\\nThe banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her voice was\\ngone.\\n\\nCrack! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a circle,\\nthen -- crack!- became a rattlesnake, which slithered and writhed before\\n-- crack! -- becoming a single, bloody eyeball.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s confused!\" shouted Lupin. \"We\\'re getting there! Dean!\"\\n\\nDean hurried forward.\\n\\nCrack! The eyeball became a severed hand, which flipped over and began\\nto creep along the floor like a crab.\\n\\n\"Riddikulus!\" yelled Dean.\\n\\n\\'There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.\\n\\n\"Excellent! Ron, you next!\"\\n\\nRon leapt forward.\\n\\nCrack!\\n\\nQuite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and covered\\nin hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a\\nmoment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then --\\n\\n\"Riddikulus!\" bellowed Ron, and the spider\\'s legs vanished; it rolled\\nover and over; Lavender Brown squealed and ran out of its way and it\\ncame to a halt at Harry\\'s feet. He raised his wand, ready, but --\\n\\n\"Here!\" shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. Crack!\\n\\nThe legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked wildly\\naround to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in\\nthe air in front of Lupin, who said, \"Riddikulus!\" almosi lazily.\\n\\nCrack!\\n\\n\"Forward, Neville, and finish him off!\" said Lupin as the boggart landed\\non the floor as a cockroach. Crack! Snape was back. This time Neville\\ncharged forward looking determined.\\n\\n\"Riddikulus!\" he shouted, and they had a split second\\'s view of Snape in\\nhis lacy dress before Neville let out a great \"Ha!\" of laughter, and the\\nboggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke, and was\\ngone.\\n\\n\"Excellent!\" cried Professor Lupin as the class broke into applause.\\n\"Excellent) Neville. Well done, everyone.... Let me See... five points\\nto Gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart -- ten for Neville\\nbecause he did it twice... and five each to Hermione and Harry.\"\\n\\n\"But I didn\\'t do anything,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the\\nclass, Harry,\" Lupin said lightly. \"Very well, everyone, an excellent\\nlesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it\\nfor me... to be handed in on Monday. That will be all.\"\\n\\nTalking excitedly, the class left the staffroom. Harry, however, wasn\\'t\\nfeeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from\\ntackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he\\'d seen Harry collapse on\\nthe train, and thought he wasn\\'t up to much? Had he thought Harry would\\npass out again?\\n\\nBut no one else seemed to have noticed anything.\\n\\n\"Did you see me take that banshee?\" shouted Seamus. \"And the hand!\" said\\nDean, waving his own around.\\n\\n\"And Snape in that hat!\" \"And my mummy!\"\\n\\nI wonder why Professor Lupin\\'s frightened of crystal balls?\" said\\nLavender thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we\\'ve ever had,\\nwasn\\'t it?\" said Ron excitedly as they made their way back to the\\nclassroom to get their bags.\\n\\n\"He seems like a very good teacher,\" said Hermione approvingly. \"But I\\nwish I could have had a turn with the boggart --\"\\n\\n\"What would it have been for you?\" said Ron, sniggering. \"A piece of\\nhomework that only got nine out of ten?\"\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\nFLIGHT OF THE FAT FADY\\n\\nIn no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most\\npeople\\'s favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang of Slytherins\\nhad anything bad to say about Professor Lupin.\\n\\n\"Look at the state of his robes,\" Malfoy would say in a loud whisper as\\nProfessor Lupin passed. \"He dresses like our old houseelf \"\\n\\nBut no one else cared that Professor Lupin\\'s robes were patched and\\nfrayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first.\\nAfter boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nasty little goblin like\\ncreatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons\\nof castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to\\nbludgeon those who had gotten lost. From Red Caps they moved on to\\nkappas, creepy. water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with\\nwebbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds.\\n\\nHarry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes. Worst\\nof all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these\\ndays, and no one was in any doubt why. The story of the boggart assuming\\nSnape\\'s shape, and the way that Neville had dressed it in his\\ngrandmother\\'s clothes, had traveled through the school like wildfire.\\nSnape didn\\'t seem to find it funny. His eyes flashed menacingly at the\\nvery mention of Professor Lupin\\'s name, and he was bullying Neville\\nworse than ever.\\n\\nHarry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in Professor\\nTrelawney\\'s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and\\nsymbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney\\'s enormous eyes\\nfilled with tears every time she looked at him. He couldn\\'t like\\nProfesser Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bordering\\non reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown had\\ntaken to haunting Professor Trelawney\\'s tower room at lunch times, and\\nalways returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces, as though\\nthey knew things the others didn\\'t. They had also started using hushed\\nvoices whenever they spoke to Harry, as though he were on his deathbed.\\n\\nNobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the\\naction-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid seemed to\\nhave lost his confidence. They were now spending lesson after lesson\\nlearning how to look after flobberworms, which had to be some of the\\nmost boring creatures in existence.\\n\\n\"Why would anyone bother looking after them?\" said Ron, after yet\\nanother hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms\\' throats.\\n\\nAt the start of October, however, Harry had something else to occupy\\nhim, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory\\nclasses. The Quidditch season was approaching, and O1iver Wood, Captain\\nof the Gryffindor team, called a meeting on Thursday evening to discuss\\ntactics for the new season.\\n\\nThere were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, whose job it\\nwas to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, soccer-sized ball)\\nthrough one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each\\n\\nend of the field; two Beaters, who were equipped with heavy bats to\\nrepel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to\\nattack the players); a Keeper, who defended the goal\\n\\nposts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catching\\nthe Golden Snitch, a tiny, winged, walnut-sized ball, whose capture\\nended the game and earned the Seeker\\'s team an extra one hundred and\\nfifty points.\\n\\nOliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh and final\\nyear at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice a\\'s\\nhe addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on\\nthe edge of the darkening Quidditch field.\\n\\n\"This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup,\"\\nhe told them, striding up and down in front of them. \"I\\'ll be leaving at\\nthe end of this year. I\\'ll never get another shot at it.\"\\n\\n\"Gryffindor hasn\\'t won for seven years now. Okay, so we\\'ve had the worst\\nluck in the world -- injuries -- then the tournamentgetting called off\\nlast year Wood swallowed, as though the memory still brought a lump to\\nhis throat. \"But we also know we\\'ve got the\\nbest-ruddy-team-in-the-school,\" he said, punching a fist into his other\\nhand, the old manic glint back in his eye. \"We\\'ve got three superb\\nChasers.\"\\n\\nWood pointed at Alicia Spinner, Angelina Johnson, and Katie Bell.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got two unbeatable Beaters.\"\\n\\n\"Stop it, Oliver, you\\'re embarrassing us,\" said Fred and George Weasley\\ntogether, pretending to blush.\\n\\n\"And we\\'ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match!\" Wood\\nrumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. \"And me,\" he\\nadded as an afterthought.\\n\\n\"We think you\\'re very good too, Oliver,\" said George.\\n\\n\"Spanking good Keeper,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"The point is,\" Wood went on, resuming his pacing, \"the Quidditch Cup\\nshould have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry\\njoined the team, I\\'ve thought the thing was in the bag. But we haven\\'t\\ngot it, and this year\\'s the last chance we\\'ll get to finally see our\\nname on the thing....\"\\n\\nWood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked sympathetic.\\n\\n\"Oliver, this year\\'s our year,\" said Fred.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll do it, Oliver!\" said Angelina.\\n\\n\"Definitely,\" said Harry.\\n\\nFull of determination, the team started training sessions, three\\nevenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the nights\\ndarker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish Harry\\'s\\nwonderful vision of finally winning the huge, silver Quidditch Cup.\\n\\nHarry returned to the Gryffindor common room one evening after training,\\ncold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone, to find the\\nroom buzzing excitedly.\\n\\n\"What\\'s happened?\", he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sitting in two\\nof the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for\\nAstronomy.\\n\\n\"First Hogsmeade weekend,\" said Ron, pointing at a notice that had\\nappeared on the battered old bulletin board. \"End of October.\\nHalloween.\"\\n\\n\"Excellent,\" said Fred, who had followed Harry through the portrait\\nhole. \"I need to visit Zonko\\'s. I\\'m nearly out of Stink Pellets.\"\\n\\nHarry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits ebbing\\naway. Hermione seemed to read his mind.\\n\\n\"Harry, I\\'m sure you\\'ll be able to go next time,\" she said. \"They\\'re\\nbound to catch Black soon. He\\'s been sighted once already.\"\\n\\n\"Black\\'s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade,\" said Ron. \"Ask\\nMcGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for\\nages --\"\\n\\n\"Ron!\" said Hermione. \"Harry\\'s supposed to stay in school-\"\\n\\n\"He can\\'t be the only third year left behind,\" said Ron. \"Ask\\nMcGonagall, go on, Harry --\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I think I will,\" said Harry, making up his mind.\\n\\nHermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment Crookshanks leapt\\nlightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was dangling from his mouth.\\n\\n\"Does he have to eat that in front of us?\" said Ron, scowling.\\n\\n\"Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?\" said Hermione.\\n\\nCrookshanks; slowly chewed up the spider, his yellow eyes fixed\\ninsolently on Ron.\\n\\n\"Just keep him over there, that\\'s all,\" said Ron irritably, turning back\\nto his star chart. \"1\\'ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.\"\\n\\nHarry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his own\\nstar chart to complete. He pulled his bag toward him, took out\\nparchment, ink, and quill, and started work.\\n\\n\"You can copy mine, if you like,\" said Ron, labeling his last star with\\na flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry.\\n\\nHermione, who disapproved of copying, pursed her lips but didn\\'t say\\nanything. Crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking\\nthe end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he pounced.\\n\\n\"OY!\" Ron roared, seizing his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets of claws\\ndeep inside it and began tearing ferociously. \"GET OFF, YOU STUPID\\nANIMAL!\"\\n\\nRon tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crookshanks clung\\non, spitting and slashing.\\n\\n\"Ron, don\\'t hurt him!\" squealed Hermione; the whole common room was\\nwatching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it,\\nand Scabbers came flying out of the top -\\n\\n\"CATCH THAT CAR\\' Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed himself from the\\nremnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased after the\\nterrified Scabbers.\\n\\nGeorge Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; Scabbers\\nstreaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of\\ndrawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low on his bandy legs,\\nand started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw.\\n\\nRon and Hermione hurried over; Hermione grabbed Crookshanks around the\\nmiddle and heaved him away; Ron threw himself onto his stomach and, with\\ngreat difficulty, pulled Scabbers out by the tail.\\n\\n\"Look at him!\" he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scabbers in front\\nof her. \"He\\'s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!\"\\n\\n\"Crookshanks doesn\\'t understand it\\'s wrong!\" said Hermione, her voice\\nshaking. \"All cats chase rats, Ron!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s something funny about that animal!\" said Ron, who was trying to\\npersuade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his pocket. \"It heard\\nme say that Scabbers was in my bag!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, what rubbish,\" said Hermione impatiently. \"Crookshanks could smell\\nhim, Ron, how else d\\'you think --\"\\n\\n\"That cat\\'s got it in for Scabbers!\" said Ron, \\'ignoring the people\\naround him, who were starting to giggle. \"And Scabbers was here first,\\nand he\\'s ill!\"\\n\\nRon marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to\\nthe boys\\' dormitories.\\n\\nRon was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely talked to\\nher all through Herbology, even though he, Harry, and Hermione were\\nworking together on the same puffapod.\\n\\n\"How\\'s Scabbers?\" Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods\\nfrom the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail.\\n\\n\"He\\'s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking, \" said Ron angrily,\\nmissing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor.\\n\\n\"Careful, Weasley, careful!\" cried Professor Sprout as the beans burst\\ninto bloom before their very eyes.\\n\\nThey had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask Professor\\nMcGonagall after the lesson whether he could go into Hogsmeade with the\\nrest, joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was\\ngoing to argue his case. He was distracted, however, by a disturbance at\\nthe front of the line.\\n\\nLavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm around her and\\nwas explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were\\nlooking very serious.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Lavender?\" said Hermione anxiously as she, Harry,\\nand Ron went to join the group.\\n\\n\"She got a letter from home this morning,\" Parvati whispered. \"It\\'s her\\nrabbit, Binky. He\\'s been killed by a fox.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Hermione, \"I\\'m sorry, Lavender.\"\\n\\n\"I should have known!\" said Lavender tragically. \"You know what day it\\nis?\"\\n\\n\"Er --\"\\n\\n\"The sixteenth of October! \\'That thing you\\'re dreading, it will happen\\non the sixteenth of October!\\' Remember? She was right, she was right!\"\\n\\nThe whole class was gathered around Lavender now. Seamus shook his head\\nseriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, \"You -- you were dreading\\nBinky being killed by a fox?\"\\n\\n\"Well, not necessarily by a fox,\" said Lavender, looking up at Hermione\\nwith streaming eyes, \"but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn\\'t l?\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Hermione. She paused again. Then\\n\\n\"Was Binky an old rabbit?\"\\n\\n\"N -- no!\" sobbed Lavender. \"H -- he was only a baby!\"\\n\\nParvati tightened her arm around Lavender\\'s shoulders.\\n\\n\"But then, why would you dread him dying?\" said Hermione.\\n\\nParvati glared at her.\\n\\n\"Well, look at it logically,\" said Hermione, turning to the rest of the\\ngroup- \"I mean, Binky didn\\'t even die today, did he? Lavender just got\\nthe news today-\" Lavender wailed loudly. \"- and she can\\'t have been\\ndreading it, because it\\'s come as a real shock --\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mind Hermione, Lavender,\" said Ron loudly, \"she doesn\\'t think\\nother people\\'s pets matter very much.\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that moment, which was\\nperhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking daggers at each other, and\\nwhen they got into class, they seated themselves on either side of Harry\\nand didn\\'t talk to each other for the whole class.\\n\\nHarry still hadn\\'t decided what he was going to say to Professor\\nMcGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was she\\nwho brought up the subject of Hogsmeade first.\\n\\n\"One moment, please !\" she called as the class made to leave. \"As you\\'re\\nall in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before\\nHalloween. No form, no visiting the village, so don\\'t forget!\"\\n\\nNeville put up his hand.\\n\\n\"Please, Professor, I -- I think I\\'ve lost\\n\\n\"Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,\" said Professor\\nMcGonagall. \"She seemed to think it was safer. Well, that\\'s all, you may\\nleave.\"\\n\\n\"Ask her now,\" Ron hissed at Harry.\\n\\n\"Oh. but --\" Hermione began.\\n\\n\"Go for it, Harry,\" said Ron stubbornly.\\n\\nHarry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed\\nnervously for Professor McGonagall\\'s desk.\\n\\n\"Yes, Potter?\" Harry took a deep breath.\\n\\n\"Professor, my aunt and uncle -- er -- forgot to sign my form,\" he said.\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but didn\\'t\\nsay anything.\\n\\n\"So -- er d\\'you think it would be all right mean, will It be okay if I\\n-- if I go to Hogsmeade?\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk.\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid not, Potter,\" she said. \"You heard what I said. No form, no\\nvisiting the village. That\\'s the rule.\"\\n\\n\"But -- Professor, my aunt and uncle -- you know, they\\'re Muggles, they\\ndon\\'t really understand about -- about Hogwarts forms and stuff,\" Harry\\nsaid, while Ron egged him on with vigorous nods. \"If you said I could go\\n--\"\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t say so,\" said Professor McGonagall, standing up and piling\\nher papers neatly into a drawer. \"The form clearly states that the\\nparent or guardian must give permission.\" She turned to look at him,\\nwith an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? \"I\\'m sorry, Potter, but\\nthat\\'s my final word. You had better hurry, or you\\'ll be late for your\\nnext lesson.\"\\n\\nThere was nothing to be done. Ron called Professor McGonagall a lot of\\nnames that greatly annoyed Hermione; Hermione assumed an\\n\"all-for-the-best\" expression that made Ron even angrier, and Harry had\\nto endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what\\nthey were going to do first, once they got into Hogsmeade.\\n\\n\"There\\'s always the feast,\" said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry UP.\\n\"You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry gloomily, \"great.\"\\n\\nThe Halloween feast was always good, but it would taste a lot better if\\nhe was coming to it after a day in Hogsmeade with everyone else. Nothing\\nanyone said made him feel any better about being left behind. Dean\\nThomas, who was good with a quill, had offered to forge Uncle Vernon\\'s\\nsignature on the form, but as Harry had already told Professor\\nMcGonagall he hadn\\'t had it signed, that was no good. Ron halfheartedly\\nsuggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one,\\nreminding Ron what Dumbledore had told them about the dementors being\\nable to see through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful\\nwords of comfort.\\n\\n\"They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it\\'s not all\\nit\\'s cracked up to be,\" he said seriously. \"All right, the sweetshop\\'s\\nrather good, and Zonko\\'s Joke Shop\\'s frankly dangerous, and yes, the\\nShrieking Shack\\'s always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from\\nthat, you\\'re not missing anything.\"\\n\\nOn Halloween morning, Harry awoke with the rest and went down to\\nbreakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his best to act\\nnormally.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll bring you. lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,\" said Hermione,\\nlooking desperately sorry for him.\\n\\n\"Yeah, loads,\" said Ron. He and Hermione had finally forgotten their\\nsquabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry\\'s difficulties.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry about me,\" said Harry, in what he hoped was at, offhand\\nvoice, \"I\\'ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.\"\\n\\nHe accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the caretaker,\\nwas standing inside the front doors, checking off names against a long\\nlist, peering suspiciously into every face, and making sure that no one\\nwas sneaking out who shouldn\\'t be going.\\n\\n\"Staying here, Potter?\" shouted Malfoy, who was standing in line with\\nCrabbe and Goyle. \"Scared of passing the dementors?\"\\n\\nHarry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase,\\nthrough the deserted corridors, and back to Gryffindor Tower.\\n\\n\"Password?\" said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze.\\n\\n\"Fortuna Major,\" said Harry listlessly.\\n\\nThe portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common\\nroom. It was full of chattering first and second years, and a few older\\nstudents, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so often the novelty had\\nworn off\\n\\n\"Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!\"\\n\\nIt was Colin Creevey, a second year who was deeply in awe of Harry and\\nnever missed an opportunity to speak to him.\\n\\n\"Aren\\'t you going to Hogsmeade, Harry? Why not? Hey\" -- Colin looked\\neagerly around at his friends -- \"you can come and sit with us, if you\\nlike, Harry!\"\\n\\n\"Er -- no, thanks, Colin,\" said Harry, who wasn\\'t in the mood to have a\\nlot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. \"I -- I\\'ve got\\nto go to the library, got to get some work done.\"\\n\\nAfter that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out\\nof the portrait hole again.\\n\\n\"What was the point waking me up?\" the Fat Lady called grumpily after\\nhim as he walked away.\\n\\nHarry wandered dispiritedly toward the library, but halfway there he\\nchanged his mind; he didn\\'t feel like working. He turned around and came\\nface-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just seen off the last of the\\nHogsmeade visitors.\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" Filch snarled suspiciously.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said Harry truthfully.\\n\\n\"Nothing!\" spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. \"A likely\\nstory! Sneaking around on your own -- why aren\\'t you in Hogsmeade buying\\nStink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing Worms like the rest of your\\nnasty little friends?\"\\n\\nHarry shrugged.\\n\\n\"Well, get back to your common room where you belong!\" snapped Filch,\\nand he stood glaring until Harry had passed out of sight.\\n\\nBut Harry didn\\'t go back to the common room; he climbed a staircase,\\nthinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking\\nalong another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said,\\n\"Harry?\"\\n\\nHarry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor Lupin,\\nlooking around his office door.\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" said Lupin, though in a very different voice from\\nFilch. \"Where are Ron and Hermione?\"\\n\\n\"Hogsmeade,\" said Harry, in a would-be casual voice.\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Lupin. He considered Harry for a moment. \"Why don\\'t you come\\nin? I\\'ve just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson.\" \"A\\nwhat?\" said Harry. I\\n\\nHe followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very large tank\\nof water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face\\npressed against the glass, pulling faces and flexing its long, spindly\\nfingers.\\n\\n\"Water demon,\" said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thoughtfully. \"We\\nshouldn\\'t have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick\\nis to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong,\\nbut very brittle.\"\\n\\nThe grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle\\nof weeds in a corner.\\n\\n\"Cup of tea?\" Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. \"I was just\\nthinking of making one.\"\\n\\n\"All right,\" said Harry awkwardly.\\n\\nLupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued\\nsuddenly from the spout.\\n\\n\"Sit down,\" said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. \"I\\'ve only got\\nteabags, I\\'m afraid -- but I daresay you\\'ve had enough of tea leaves?\"\\n\\nHarry looked at him. Lupin\\'s eyes were twinkling.\\n\\n\"How did you know about that?\" Harry asked.\\n\\n\"Professor McGonagall told me,\" said Lupin, passing Harry a chipped mug\\nof tea. \"You\\'re not worried, are you?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry.\\n\\nHe thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he\\'d seen in\\nMagnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn\\'t want Lupin to think he\\nwas a coward, especially since Lupin alreadv seemed to think he couldn\\'t\\ncope with a boggart.\\n\\nSomething of Harry\\'s thoughts seemed to have shown on his face, because\\nLupin said, \"Anything worrying you, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow\\nbrandishing a fist at him. \"Yes,\" he said suddenly, putting his tea down\\non Lupin\\'s desk. \"You know that day we fought the boggart?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Lupin slowly.\\n\\n\"Why didn\\'t you let me fight it?\" said Harry abruptly.\\n\\nLupin raised his eyebrows.\\n\\n\"I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,\" he said, sounding\\nsurprised.\\n\\nHarry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he\\'d done any such thing, was\\ntaken aback.\\n\\n\"Why?\" he said again.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Lupin, frowning slightly, \"I assumed that if the boggart\\nfaced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.\"\\n\\nHarry stared. Not only was this the last answer he\\'d expected, but Lupin\\nhad said Voldemort\\'s name. The only person Harry had ever heard say the\\nname aloud (apart from himself) was Professor Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Clearly, I was wrong,\" said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. \"But I\\ndidn\\'t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in the\\nstaffroom. I imagined that people would panic.\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t think of Voldemort,\" said Harry honestly. \"I -- I remembered\\nthose dementors.\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said Lupin thoughtfully. \"Well, well... I\\'m impressed.\" fie\\nsmiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry\\'s face. \"That suggests\\nthat what you fear most of all is -- fear. Very wise, Harry.\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to say to that, so he drank some mot,, tea.\\n\\n\"So you\\'ve been thinking that I didn\\'t believe you capable of fighting\\nthe boggart?\" said Lupin shrewdly.\\n\\n\"Well... yeah,\" said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot happier.\\n\"Professor Lupin, you know the dementors --\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a knock on the door.\\n\\n\"Come in,\" called Lupin.\\n\\nThe door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, which was\\nsmoking faintly, and stopped at the sight of Harry, his black eyes\\nnarrowing.\\n\\n\"Ah, Severus,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Thanks very much. Could you leave\\nit here on the desk for me?\"\\n\\nSnape set down the smoking goblet, his eyes wandering between Harry and\\nLupin.\\n\\n\"I was just showing Harry my grindylow,\" said Lupin pleasantly, pointing\\nat the tank.\\n\\n\"Fascinating,\" said Snape, without looking at it. \"You should drink that\\ndirectly, Lupin.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Yes, I will,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"I made an entire cauldronful,\" Snape continued. \"If you need more.\\n\\n\"I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn\\'t\\nlike. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful.\\n\\nHarry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled.\\n\\n\"Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,\" he said. \"I\\nhave never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly\\ncomplex.\" He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. \"Pity sugar makes it\\nuseless,\" he added, taking a sip and shuddering.\\n\\n\"Why --?\" Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished\\nquestion.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been feeling a bit off-color,\" he said. \"This potion is the only\\nthing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Professor\\nSnape; there aren\\'t many wizards who are up to making it.\"\\n\\nProfessor Lupin took another sip and Harry had a crazy urge to knock the\\ngoblet out of his hands.\\n\\n\"Professor Snape\\'s very interested in the Dark Arts, he blurted out.\\n\\n\"Really?\" said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took another\\ngulp of potion.\\n\\n\"Some people reckon --\" Harry hesitated, then plunged recklessly on,\\n\"some people reckon he\\'d do anything to get the Defense Against the Dark\\nArts job.\"\\n\\nLupin drained the goblet and pulled a face.\\n\\n\"Disgusting,\" he said. \"Well, Harry, I\\'d better get back to work. see\\nyou at the feast later.\"\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Harry, putting down his empty teacup.\\n\\nThe empty goblet was still smoking.\\n\\n\"There you go,\" said Ron. \"We got as much as we could carry.\"\\n\\nA shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into Harry\\'s lap. It was\\ndusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common room,\\npink-faced from the cold wind and looking as though they\\'d had the time\\nof their lives.\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper Imps.\\n\"What\\'s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?\"\\n\\nBy the sound of it -- everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding\\nequipment shop, Zonko\\'s Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for\\nfoaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.\\n\\n\"The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves,\\nall color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get\\nthere!\"\\n\\n\"Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free\\nsamples, there\\'s a bit, look --\"\\n\\n\"We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three\\nBroomsticks --\"\\n\\n\"Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up --\"\\n\\n\"What did you do?\" said Hermione, looking anxious. \"Did you get any work\\ndone?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then\\nSnape came in....\"\\n\\nHe told them all about the goblet. Ron\\'s mouth fell open.\\n\\n\"Lupin drank it?\" he gasped. \"Is he mad?\"\\n\\nHermione checked her watch.\\n\\n\"We\\'d better go down, you know, the feast\\'ll be starting in fiveminutes\\nThey hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd, still\\ndiscussing Snape.\\n\\n\"But if he -- you know\" -- Hermione dropped her voice, glancing\\nnervously around -- \"if he was trying to to poison Lupin -- he wouldn\\'t\\nhave done it in front of Harry.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, maybe,\" said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed\\ninto the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of\\ncandle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live bats, and many\\nflaming orange streamers, which were swimming lazily across the stormy\\nceiling like brilliant watersnakes.\\n\\nThe food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full to bursting\\nwith Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry\\nkept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin\\n\\nlooked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he was talking animatedly to\\ntiny little Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher. Harry moved his eyes\\nalong the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was he imagining it, or\\nwere Snape\\'s eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?\\n\\nThe feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hogwarts\\nghosts. They popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation\\ngliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success\\nwith a reenactment of his own botched beheading.\\n\\nIt had been such a pleasant evening that Harry\\'s good mood couldn\\'t even\\nbe spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the crowd as they all left the\\nhall, \"The dementors send their love, Potter!\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors along the\\nusual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that\\nended with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they found it jammed with\\nstudents.\\n\\n\"Why isn\\'t anyone going in?\" said Ron curiously.\\n\\nHarry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait seemed to be\\nclosed.\\n\\n\"Let me through, please,\" came Percy\\'s voice, and he came bustling\\nimportantly through the crowd. \"What\\'s the holdup here? You can\\'t all\\nhave forgotten the password -- excuse me, I\\'m Head Boy --\"\\n\\nAnd then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so that a\\nchill seemed to spread down the corridor. They heard Percy say, in a\\nsuddenly sharp voice, \"Somebody get Professor Dumbledore. Quick.\"\\n\\nPeople\\'s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tiptoe.\\n\\n\"What\\'s going on?\" said Ginny, who had just arrived.\\n\\nA moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping toward the\\nportrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him through, and\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was.\\n\\n\"Oh, my --\" Hermione grabbed Harry\\'s arm.\\n\\nThe Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been slashed so\\nviciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great chunks of it\\nhad been torn away completely.\\n\\nDumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned, his\\neyes somber, to see Professors McGonagall, Lupin, and Snape hurrying\\ntoward him.\\n\\n\"We need to find her,\" said Dumbledore. \"Professor McGonagall, please go\\nto Mr. Filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle\\nfor the Fat Lady.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be lucky!\" said a cackling voice.\\n\\nIt was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and looking\\ndelighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry.\\n\\n\"What do you mean, Peeves?\" said Dumbledore calmly, and Peeves\\'s grin\\nfaded a little. He didn\\'t dare taunt Dumbledore. Instead he adopted an\\noily voice that was no better than his cackle. \"Ashamed, Your Headship,\\nsit. Doesn\\'t want to be seen. She\\'s a horrible mess. Saw her running\\nthrough the landscape up on the fourth floor, sir, dodging between the\\ntrees. Crying something dreadful,\" he said happily. \"Poor thing,\" he\\nadded unconvincingly.\\n\\n\"Did she say who did it?\" said Dumbledore quietly.\\n\\n\"Oh yes, Professorhead,\" said Peeves, with the air of one cradling a\\nlarge bombshell in his arms. \"He got very angry when she wouldn\\'t let\\nhim in, you see.\" Peeves flipped over and grinned at Dumbledore from\\nbetween his own legs. \"Nasty temper he\\'s got, that Sirius Black.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER NINE\\n\\nGRIM DEFEAT\\n\\nProfessor Dumbledore sent all the Gryffindors back to the Great Hall,\\nwhere they were joined ten minutes later by the students from\\nHufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, who all looked extremely confused.\\n\\n\"The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the castle,\"\\nProfessor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall and Flitwick\\nclosed all doors into the hall. \"I\\'m afraid that, for your own safety,\\nyou will have to spend the night here. I want the prefects to stand\\nguard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and\\nGirl in charge. Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately,\"\\nhe added to Percy, who was looking immensely proud and important. \"Send\\nword with one of the ghosts.\"\\n\\nProfessor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, \"Oh,\\nyes, you\\'ll be needing...\"\\n\\nOne casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the\\nhall and stood themselves against the walls; another wave, and the floor\\nwas covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags.\\n\\n\"Sleep well,\" said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him.\\n\\nThe hall immediately began to buzz excitedly; the Gryffindors were\\ntelling the rest of the school what had just happened.\\n\\n\"Everyone into their sleeping bags!\" shouted Percy. \"Come on, now, no\\nmore talking! Lights out in ten minutes!\"\\n\\n\"C\\'mon,\" Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three sleeping bags\\nand dragged them into a corner.\\n\\n\"Do you think Black\\'s still in the castle?\" Hermione whispered\\nanxiously.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,\" said Hermione as they\\nclimbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on\\ntheir elbows to talk. \"The one night we weren\\'t in the tower....\"\\n\\nI reckon he\\'s lost track of time, being on the run,\" said Ron. \"Didn\\'t\\nrealize it was Halloween. Otherwise he\\'d have come bursting in here.\"\\n\\nHermione shuddered.\\n\\nAll around them, people were asking one another the same question: \"How\\ndid he get in?\"\\n\\n\"Maybe he knows how to Apparate,\" said a Ravenclaw a few feet away,\\n\"Just appear out of thin air, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Disguised himself, probably,\" said a Hufflepuff fifth year. \"He\\ncould\\'ve flown in,\" suggested Dean Thomas.\\n\\n\"Honestly, am I the only person who\\'s ever bothered to read Hogwarts, A\\nHistory?\" said Hermione crossly to Harry and Ron.\\n\\n\"Probably,\" said Ron. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because the castle\\'s protected by more than walls, You know,,, said\\nHermione. \"There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people\\nentering by stealth. You can\\'t just Apparate in here. And I\\'d like to\\nsee the disguise that could fool those dementors. They\\'re guarding every\\nsingle entrance to the grounds. They\\'d have seen him fly in too. And\\nFitch knows all the secret passages, they\\'ll have them covered....\"\\n\\n\"The lights are going out now!\" Percy shouted. \"I want everyone in their\\nsleeping bags and no more talking!\"\\n\\nThe candles all went out at once. The only light now came from the\\nsilvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the\\nprefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was\\nscattered with stars. What with that, and the whispering that still\\nfilled the hall, Harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a\\nlight wind.\\n\\nOnce every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that\\neverything was quiet. Around three in the morning, when many students\\nhad finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore came in. Harry watched\\nhim looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping\\nbags, telling people off for talking. Percy was only a short way away\\nfrom Harry, Ron, and Hermlone, who quickly pretended to be asleep as\\nDumbledore\\'s footsteps drew nearer.\\n\\n\"Any sign of him, Professor?\" asked Percy in a whisper.\\n\\n\"No. All well here?\"\\n\\n\"Everything under control, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Good. There\\'s no point moving them all now. I\\'ve found a temporary\\nguardian for the Gryffindor portrait hole. You\\'ll be able to move them\\nback in tomorrow.\"\\n\\n\"And the Fat Lady, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently she\\nrefused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She\\'s\\nstill very distressed, but once she\\'s calmed down, I\\'ll have Mr. Filch\\nrestore her.\"\\n\\nHarry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more footsteps.\\n\\n\"Headmaster?\" It was Snape. Harry kept quite still, listening hard. \"The\\nwhole of the third floor has been searched. He\\'s not there. And Filch\\nhas done the dungeons; nothing there either.\"\\n\\n\"What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney\\'s room? The\\nOwlery?\"\\n\\n\"All searched.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Severus. I didn\\'t really expect Black to linger.\"\\n\\n\"Have you any theory as to how he got in, Professor?\" asked Snape.\\n\\nHarry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear,\\n\\n\"Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.\"\\n\\nHarry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood;\\nDumbledore\\'s back was to him, but he could see Percy\\'s face, rapt with\\nattention, and Snape\\'s profile, which looked angry.\\n\\n\"You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just before -- ah --\\nthe start of term?\" said Snape, who was barely opening his lips, as\\nthough trying to block Percy out of the conversation.\\n\\n\"I do, Severus,\" said Dumbledore, and there was something like warning\\nin his voice.\\n\\n\"It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the\\nschool without inside help. I did express my concerns whet, you\\nappointed --\"\\n\\n\"I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped\\nBlack enter it,\" said Dumbledore, and his tone made it so clear that the\\nsubject was closed that Snape didn\\'t reply. \"I must go down to the\\ndementors,\" said Dumbledore. I said I would inform them when our search\\nwas complete.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t they want to help, sit?\" said Percy.\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Dumbledore coldly. \"But I\\'m afraid no dementor will cross\\nthe threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.\"\\n\\nPercy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking quickly\\nand quietly. Snape stood for a moment, watching the headmaster with an\\nexpression of deep resentment on his face; then he too left.\\n\\nHarry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them had their eyes\\nopen too, reflecting the starry ceiling.\\n\\n\"\\\\What was all that about?\" Ron mouthed.\\n\\nThe school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. The\\ntheories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder;\\nHannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class\\ntelling anyone who\\'d listen that Black could turn into a flowering\\nshrub.\\n\\nThe Fat Lady\\'s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and\\n\\nReplaced with the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his fat gray pony. Nobody\\nwas very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time challenging\\npeople to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated\\npasswords, which he changed at least twice a day.\\n\\n\"He\\'s a complete lunatic,\" said Seamus Finnigan angrily to Percy. \"Can\\'t\\nwe get anyone else?\"\\n\\n\"None of the other pictures wanted the job,\" said Percy. \"Frightened of\\nwhat happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only one brave enough\\nto volunteer.\"\\n\\nSir Cadogan, however, was the least of Harry\\'s worries. He was now being\\nclosely watched. Teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with\\nhim, and Percy Weasley (acting, Harry suspected, on his mother\\'s orders)\\nwas tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog. To cap\\nit all, Professor McGonagall summoned Harry into her office, with such a\\nsomber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,\" she said in a\\nvery serious voice. \"I know this will come as a shock to you, but Sirius\\nBlack --\"\\n\\n\"I know he\\'s after me,\" said Harry wearily. \"I heard Ron\\'s dad telling\\nhis mum. Mr. Weasley works for the Ministry of Magic.\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall seemed very taken aback. She stared at Harry for a\\nmoment or two, then said, \"I see! Well, in that case, Potter, you\\'ll\\nunderstand why I don\\'t think it\\'s a good idea for you to be practicing\\nQuidditch in the evenings. Out on the field with only Your team members,\\nit\\'s very exposed, Potter --\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got our first match on Saturday!\" said Harry, outraged. \"I\\'ve got\\nto train, Professor!\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she was deeply\\ninterested in the Gryffindor team\\'s prospects; it had been she, after\\nall, who\\'d suggested him as Seeker in the first Place. He waited,\\nholding his breath.\\n\\n\"Hmm...\" Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of the window at\\nthe Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. \"Well... goodness\\nknows, I\\'d like to see us win the Cup at last... but all the same,\\nPotter... I\\'d be happier if a teacher were present. I\\'ll ask Madam Hooch\\nto oversee your training sessions.\"\\n\\nThe weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew nearer.\\nUndaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the\\neye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training session before\\nSaturday\\'s match, Oliver Wood gave his team some unwelcome news.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not playing Slytherin!\" he told them, looking very angry.\\n\"Flint\\'s just been to see me. We\\'re playing Hufflepuff instead.\"\\n\\n\"Why?\" chorused the rest of the team.\\n\\n\"Flint\\'s excuse is that their Seeker\\'s arm\\'s still injured,\" said Wood,\\ngrinding his teeth furiously. \"But it\\'s obvious why they\\'re doing it.\\nDon\\'t want to play in this weather. Think it\\'ll damage their\\nchances....\"\\n\\nThere had been strong winds and heavy rain all day, and as Wood spoke,\\nthey heard a distant rumble of thunder.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing wrong with Malfoy\\'s arm!\" said Harry furiously. \"He\\'s\\nfaking it!\"\\n\\n\"I know that, but we can\\'t prove it,\" said Wood bitterly, \"And we\\'ve\\nbeen practicing all those moves assuming we\\'re playing Slytherin, and\\ninstead it\\'s Hufflepuff, and their style\\'s quite different. They\\'ve got\\na new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory --\"\\n\\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior.\\n\\n\"He\\'s that tall, good-looking one, isn\\'t he?\" said Angelina.\\n\\n\"Strong and silent,\" said Katie, and they started to giggle again.\\n\\n\"He\\'s only silent because he\\'s too thick to string two words together,\"\\nsaid Fred impatiently. \"I don\\'t know why you\\'re worried, Oliver,\\nHufflepuff is a pushover. Last time we played them, Harry caught the\\nSnitch in about five minutes, remember?\"\\n\\n\"We were playing in completely different conditions!\" Wood shouted, his\\neyes bulging slightly. \"Diggory\\'s put a very strong side together! He\\'s\\nan excellent Seeker! I was afraid you\\'d take it like this! We mustn\\'t\\nrelax! We must keep our focus! Slytherin is trying to wrong-foot us! We\\nmust win!\"\\n\\n\"Oliver, calm down!\" said Fred, looking slightly alarmed. \"We\\'re taking\\nHufflepuff very seriously. Seriously.\"\\n\\nThe day before the match, the winds reached howling point and the rain\\nfell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and\\nclassrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin team\\nwas looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy.\\n\\n\"Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!\" he sighed as the gale\\noutside pounded the windows.\\n\\nHarry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match\\ntomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving\\nhim tips. The third time this happened, Wood talked for so long that\\nHarry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for Defense Against the\\nDark Arts, and set off at a run with Wood shouting after him, \"Diggory\\'s\\ngot a very fast swerve, Harry, so you might want to try looping him --\"\\n\\nHarry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark Arts\\nclassroom, pulled the door open, and dashed inside.\\n\\n\"Sorry I\\'m late, Professor Lupin. I --\"\\n\\nBut it wasn\\'t Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the teacher\\'s\\ndesk; it was Snape.\\n\\n\"This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we\\'ll make it ten\\npoints from Gryffindor. Sit down.\"\\n\\nBut Harry didn\\'t move.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Professor Lupin?\" he said.\\n\\n\"He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,\" said Snape with a\\ntwisted smile. \"I believe I told you to sit down?\"\\n\\nBut Harry stayed where he was.\\n\\n\"What\\'s wrong with him?\"\\n\\nSnape\\'s black eyes glittered.\\n\\n\"Nothing life-threatening,\" he said, looking as though he wished it\\nwere. \"Five more points from Gryffindor, and if I have to ask you to sit\\ndown again, it will be fifty.\"\\n\\nHarry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked around at the\\nclass.\\n\\n\"As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has not left\\nany record of the topics you have covered so far --\"\\n\\n\"Please, sir, we\\'ve done boggarts, Red Caps, kappas, and grindylows,\"\\nsaid Hermione quickly, \"and we\\'re just about to start --\"\\n\\n\"Be quiet,\" said Snape coldly. \"I did not ask for information. I was\\nmerely commenting on Professor Lupin\\'s lack of organization.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we\\'ve ever had,\"\\nsaid Dean Thomas boldly, and there was a murmur of agreement from the\\nrest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than ever.\\n\\n\"You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you -- I ,Would\\nexpect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and grindylows.\\nToday we shall discuss --\"\\n\\nHarry watched him flick through the textbook, to the very back chapter,\\nwhich he must know they hadn\\'t covered.\\n\\n\"Werewolves,\" said Snape.\\n\\n\"But, sir,\" said Hermione, seemingly unable to restrain herself, \"we\\'re\\nnot supposed to do werewolves yet, we\\'re due to start hinkypunks --\"\\n\\n\"Miss Granger,\" said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, \"I was under the\\nimpression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you\\nall to turn to page 394.\" He glanced around again. \\'All of you! Now!\"\\n\\nWith many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the class\\nopened their books.\\n\\n\"Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and\\nthe true wolf?\" said Snape.\\n\\nEveryone sat in motionless silence; everyone except Hermione, whose\\nhand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air.\\n\\n\"Anyone?\" Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back.\\n\"Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn\\'t even taught you the\\nbasic distinction between --\"\\n\\n\"We told you,\" said Parvati suddenly, \"we haven\\'t got as far as\\nwerewolves yet, we\\'re still on --\"\\n\\n\"Silence!\" snarled Snape. \"Well, well, well, I never thought I\\'d meet a\\nthird-year class who wouldn\\'t even recognize a werewolf when they saw\\none. I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very\\nbehind you all are....\"\\n\\n\"Please, sir,\" said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, \"the\\nwerewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of\\nthe werewolf --\"\\n\\n\"That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,\"\\nsaid Snape coolly. \"Five more points from Gryffindor for being an\\ninsufferable know-it-all.\"\\n\\nHermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the floor with\\nher eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class loathed\\nSnape that they were all glaring at him, because every one of them had\\ncalled Hermione a know-it-all at least once, and Ron, who told Hermione\\nshe was a know-it-all at least twice a week, said loudly, \"You asked us\\na question and she knows the answer! Why ask if you don\\'t want to be\\ntold?\"\\n\\nThe class knew instantly he\\'d gone too far. Snape advanced on Ron\\nslowly, and the room held its breath.\\n\\n\"Detention, Weasley,\" Snape said silkily, his face very close to Ron\\'s.\\n\"And if I ever hear you criticize the way I teach a class again, you\\nwill be very sorry indeed.\"\\n\\nNo one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat and made\\nnotes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape prowled up and down\\nthe rows of desks, examining the work they had been doing with Professor\\nLupin.\\n\\n\"Very poorly explained... That is incorrect, the kappa is more commonly\\nfound in Mongolia.... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten? I\\nwouldn\\'t have given it three....\"\\n\\nWhen the bell rang at last, Snape held them back.\\n\\n\"You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you\\nrecognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment or, the\\nsubject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took\\nthis class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your\\ndetention.\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited\\nuntil they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade\\nabout Snape.\\n\\n\"Snape\\'s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the\\nDark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,\" Harry said to\\nHermione. \"Why\\'s he got it in for Lupin? D\\'you think this is all because\\nof the boggart?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Hermione pensively. \"But I really hope Professor\\nLupin gets better soon....\"\\n\\nRon caught up with them five minutes later, in a towering rage.\\n\\n\"D\\'you know what that --\" (he called Snape something that made Hermione\\nsay \"Ron!\") \"-- is making me do? I\\'ve got to scrub out the bedpans in\\nthe hospital wing. Without magic!\" He was breathing deeply, his fists\\nclenched. \"Why couldn\\'t Black have hidden in Snape\\'s office, eh? He\\ncould have finished him off for us!\"\\n\\nHarry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was till\\ndark. For a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him.\\nThen he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright\\n-- Peeves the Poltergeist had been floating next to him, blowing hard in\\nhis ear.\\n\\n\"What did you do that for?\" said Harry furiously. Peeves puffed out his\\ncheeks, blew hard, and zoomed backward out of the room, cackling.\\n\\nHarry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it. It was half past\\nfour. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep, but\\nit was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the sounds of\\nthe thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the\\ncastle walls, and the distant creaking of the trees in the Forbidden\\nForest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling\\nthrough that gale. Finally, he gave up any thought of more sleep, got\\nup, dressed, picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand, and walked quietly out\\nof the dormitory.\\n\\nAs Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. He bent\\ndown just in time to grab Crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and\\ndrag him outside.\\n\\n\"You know, I reckon Ron was right about you,\" Harry told Crookshanks\\nsuspiciously. \"There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and\\nchase them. Go on,\" he added, nudging Crookshanks down the spiral\\nstaircase with his foot. \"Leave Scabbers alone.\"\\n\\nThe noise of the storm was even louder in the common roorn. Harry knew\\nbetter than to think the match would be canceled; Quidditch matches\\nweren\\'t called off for trifles like thunderstorms. Nevertheless, he was\\nstarting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had pointed out Cedric Diggory\\nto him in the corridor; Diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than\\nHarry. Seekers were usually light\\n\\nand speedy, but Diggory\\'s weight would be an advantage in this weather\\nbecause he was less likely to be blown off course.\\n\\nHarry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, getting up\\nevery now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up\\n\\nthe boys, staircase again. At long last Harry thought it must be time\\nfor breakfast, so he headed through the portrait hole alone.\\n\\n\"Stand and fight, you mangy cur!\" yelled Sir Cadogan.\\n\\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Harry yawned.\\n\\nHe revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time he\\'d\\nstarted on toast, the rest of the team had turned up.\\n\\n\"It\\'s going to be a tough one,\" said Wood, who wasn\\'t eating anything.\\n\\n\"Stop worrying, Oliver,\" said Alicia soothingly, \"we don\\'t mind a bit of\\nrain.\"\\n\\nBut it was considerably more than a bit of rain. Such was the popularity\\nof Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as\\nusual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quidditch field, heads\\nbowed against the ferocious wind, umbrellas being whipped out of their\\nhands as they went. just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an\\nenormous umbrella on their way to the stadium.\\n\\nThe team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood\\'s usual\\npre-match pep talk, but it didn\\'t come. He tried to speak several times,\\nmade an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned\\nthem to follow him.\\n\\nThe wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out\\nonto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn\\'t hear it over\\nthe fresh rolls of thunder. Rain was splattering over Harry\\'s glasses.\\nHow on earth was he going to see the Snitch in this?\\n\\nThe Hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field,\\nwearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to eacb other and\\nshook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood no, looked as though he had\\nlockjaw and merely nodded. Harry saw Madam Hooch\\'s mouth form the words,\\n\"Mount Your brooms.,, He pulled his right foot out of the mud with a\\nsquelch and swung it over his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch put her\\nwhistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant\\nthey were off\\n\\nHarry rose fast, but his Nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind. He\\nheld it as steady as he could and turned, squinting into the rain.\\n\\nWithin five minutes Harry was soaked to his skin and frozen, hardly able\\nto see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and\\nforward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes, with no\\nidea of what was happening in the rest of the game. He couldn\\'t hear the\\ncommentary over the wind. The crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks\\nand battered umbrellas. Twice Harry came very close to being unseated by\\na Bludger; his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he\\nhadn\\'t seen them coming.\\n\\nHe lost track of time. It was getting harder and harder to hold his\\nbroom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had decided\\nto come early. Twice Harry nearly hit another player, without knowing\\nwhether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the\\nrain so thick, he could hardly tell them apart....\\n\\nWith the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam Hooch\\'s\\nwhistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick\\nrain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team splashed down into the\\nmud.\\n\\n\"I called for time-out!\" Wood roared at his team. \"Come on, under here\\n--\"\\n\\nThey huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella; Harry took\\noff his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the score?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re fifty points up,\" said Wood, \"but unless we get the Snitch soon,\\nwe\\'ll be playing into the night.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got no chance with these on,\" Harry said exasperatedly, waving his\\nglasses.\\n\\nAt that very moment, Hermione appeared at his shoulder; she was holding\\nher cloak over her head and was, inexplicably, beaming.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!\"\\n\\nHe handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, Hermione\\ntapped them with her wand and said, \"Impervius!\"\\n\\n\"There!\" she said, handing them back to Harry. \"They\\'ll repel water!\"\\n\\nWood looked as though he could have kissed her.\\n\\n\"Brilliant!\" he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the\\ncrowd. \"Okay, team, let\\'s go for it!\"\\n\\nHermione\\'s spell had done the trick. Harry was still numb with cold,\\nstill wetter than he\\'d ever been in his life, but he could see. Full of\\nfresh determination, he urged his broom through the turbulent air,\\nstaring in every direction for the Snitch, avoiding a Bludger, ducking\\nbeneath Diggory, who was streaking in the opposite direction....\\n\\nThere was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by forked\\nlightning. This was getting more and more dangerous. Harry needed to get\\nthe Snitch quickly -\\n\\nHe turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, but at\\nthat moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the stands, and\\nHarry saw something that distracted him completely , the silhouette of\\nan enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted against the sky,\\nmotionless in the topmost, empty row of seats.\\n\\nHarry\\'s numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nimbus dropped a\\nfew feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, he squinted back\\ninto the stands. The dog had vanished.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" came Wood\\'s anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal posts.\\n\"Harry, behind you!\"\\n\\nHarry looked wildly around. Cedric Diggory was pelting up the field, and\\na tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the rain-filled air between them\\n-\\n\\nWith a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broornhandle and\\nzoomed toward the Snitch.\\n\\n\"Come on!\" he growled at his Nimbus as the rain whipped his face.\\n\\'Taster!\"\\n\\nBut something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling across the\\nstadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forgetting to roar. It\\nwas as though someone had turned off the sound, as though Harry had gone\\nsuddenly deaf -- what was going on?\\n\\nAnd then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside him,\\njust as he became aware of something moving on the field below...\\n\\nBefore he\\'d had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the Snitch\\nand looked down.\\n\\nAt least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at him,\\nwere standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water were rising\\nin his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it again....\\nSomeone was screaming, screaming inside his head... a woman...\\n\\n\"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!\"\\n\\n\"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now....\"\\n\\n\"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead --\"\\n\\nNumbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry\\'s brain.... What was he\\ndoing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her... She was going to\\ndie.... She was going to be murdered....\\n\\nHe was falling, falling through the icy mist.\\n\\n\"Not Harry! Please... have mercy... have mercy....\\n\\nA shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and Harry knew no\\nmore.\\n\\n\"Lucky the ground was so soft.\"\\n\\n\"I thought he was dead for sure.\"\\n\\n\"But he didn\\'t even break his glasses.\"\\n\\nHarry could hear the voices whispering, but they made no sense\\nwhatsoever. He didn\\'t have a clue where he was, or how he\\'d got there,\\nor what he\\'d been doing before he got there. All he knew was that every\\ninch of him was aching as though it had been beaten.\\n\\n\"That was the scariest thing I\\'ve ever seen in my life.\"\\n\\nScariest... the scariest thing... hooded black figures... cold ...\\nscreaming...\\n\\nHarry\\'s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The\\nGryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, was\\ngathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as\\nthough they\\'d just climbed out of a swimming pool.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath, the mud.\\n\"How\\'re you feeling?\"\\n\\nIt was as though Harry\\'s memory was on fast forward. The lightning --\\nthe Grim -- the Snitch -- and the dementors...\\n\\n\"What happened?\" he said, sitting up so suddenly they all gasped.\\n\\n\"You fell off,\" said Fred. \"Must\\'ve been -- what -- fifty feet?\"\\n\\n\"We thought you\\'d died,\" said Alicia, who was shaking.\\n\\nHermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely bloodshot.\\n\\n\"But the match,\" said Harry. \"What happened? Are we doing a replay?\"\\n\\nNo one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a stone.\\n\\n\"We didn\\'t -- lose?\"\\n\\n\"Diggory got the Snitch,\" said George. \"Just after you fell. He didn\\'t\\nrealize what had happened. When he looked back and saw you on the\\nground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But they won fair and\\nsquare... even Wood admits it.\"\\n\\n\"Where is Wood?\" said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn\\'t there.\\n\\n\"Still in the showers,\" said Fred. \"We think he\\'s trying to drown\\nhimself.\"\\n\\nHarry put his face to his knees, his hands gripping his hair. Fred\\ngrabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon, Harry, you\\'ve never missed the Snitch before.\"\\n\\n\"There had to be one time you didn\\'t get it,\" said George.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not over yet,\" said Fred. \"We lost by a hundred points\"\\n\\n\"Right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw and\\nSlytherin --.\"\\n\\n\"Hufflepuff\\'ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,\" said\\nGeorge.\\n\\n\"But if they beat Ravenclaw...\"\\n\\n\"No Way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against\\nHufflepuff...\"\\n\\n\"It all depends on the points -- a margin of a hundred either way.\"\\n\\nHarry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost... for the first time\\never, he had lost a Quidditch match.\\n\\nAfter ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the team to\\nleave him in peace.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll come and see you later,\" Fred told him. \"Don\\'t beat yourself up,\\nHarry, you\\'re still the best Seeker we\\'ve ever had.\"\\n\\nThe team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pomfrey shut the\\ndoor behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and Hermione moved nearer to\\nHarry\\'s bed.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore was really angry,\" Hermione said in a quaking voice. \"I\\'ve\\nnever seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as You fell,\\nwaved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground.\\nThen he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.\\nThey left the stadium right away... He was furious they\\'d come onto the\\ngrounds. We heard him --\"\\n\\n\"Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,\" said Ron. \"And walked up to\\nschool with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were --\"\\n\\nHis voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking about what\\nthe dementors had done to him... about the screaming voice. He looked up\\nand saw Ron and Hermione lookin, at him so anxiously that he quickly\\ncast around for something matter-of-fact to say.\\n\\n\"Did someone get my Nimbus?\"\\n\\nRon and Hermione looked quickly at each other.\\n\\n\"Er --\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry, looking from one to the other.\\n\\n\"Well... when you fell off, it got blown away,\" said Hermione\\nhesitantly.\\n\\n\"And?\"\\n\\n\"And it hit -- it hit -- oh, Harry -- it hit the Whomping Willow.\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree\\nthat stood alone in the middle of the grounds.\\n\\n\"And?\" he said, dreading the answer.\\n\\n\"Well, you know the Whomping Willow,\" said Ron. \"It -- it doesn\\'t like\\nbeing hit.\"\\n\\n\"Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came around, said\\nHermione in a very small voice.\\n\\nSlowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside down,\\nand tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the\\nonly remains of Harry\\'s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.\\n\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\nTHE MARAUDER\\'S MAP\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the\\nrest of the weekend. He didn\\'t argue or complain, but he wouldn\\'t let\\nher throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He\\nknew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but\\nHarry couldn\\'t help it; he felt as though he\\'d lost one of his best\\nfriends.\\n\\nHe had a stream of visitors, all intent on cheering him up. Hagrid sent\\nhim a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages, and\\nGinny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she\\nhad made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry kept it shut under his\\nbowl of fruit. The Gryffindor team visited again on Sunday morning, this\\ntime accompanied by Wood, who told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of\\nvoice) that he didn\\'t blame\\n\\n\\n\\nhim in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry\\'s bedside only at\\nnight- But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any better,\\nbecause they knew only half of what was troubling him.\\n\\nHe hadn\\'t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron -and Hermione,\\nbecause he knew Ron would panic and Hermione would scoff. The fact\\nremained, however, that it had now appeared twice, and both appearances\\nhad been followed by near-fatal accidents; the first time, he had nearly\\nbeen run over by the Knight Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his\\nbroomstick. Was the Grim going to haunt him until he actually died? Was\\nhe going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the\\nbeast?\\n\\nAnd then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humiliated every\\ntime he thought of them. Everyone said the dementors were horrible, but\\nno one else collapsed every time they went near one. No one else heard\\nechoes in their head of their dying parents.\\n\\nBecause Harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now. He had\\nheard her words, heard them over and over again during the night hours\\nin the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at the strips of\\nmoonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors approached him, he heard\\nthe last moments of his mother\\'s life, her attempts to protect him,\\nHarry, from Lord Voldemort, and Voldemort\\'s laughter before he murdered\\nher.... Harry dozed fitfully, sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted\\nhands and petrified pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his\\nmother\\'s voice.\\n\\nIt was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on\\nMonday, where he was forced to think about other things, eve\\', if he had\\nto endure Draco Malfoys taunting. Malfoy was almost beside himself with\\nglee at Gryffindor\\'s defeat. He had finally taken off his bandages, and\\ncelebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited\\nimitations of Harry falling off his broom. Malfoy spent much of their\\nnext Potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon; Ron\\nfinally cracked and flung a large, slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy,\\nwhich hit him in the face and caused Snape to take fifty points from\\nGryffindor.\\n\\n\"If Snape\\'s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I\\'m skiving\\noff,\" said Ron as they headed toward Lupin\\'s classroom after lunch.\\n\"Check who\\'s in there, Hermione.\"\\n\\nHermione peered around the classroom door.\\n\\n\"It\\'s okay!\"\\n\\nProfessor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though he had\\nbeen ill. His old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were\\ndark shadows beneath his eyes; nevertheless, he smiled at the class as\\nthey took their seats, and they burst at once into an explosion of\\ncomplaints about Snape\\'s behavior while Lupin had been ill.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us homework?\"\\n\\n\"We don\\'t know anything about werewolves two rolls of parchment!\"\\n\\n\"Did you tell Professor Snape we haven\\'t covered them yet?\" Lupin asked,\\nfrowning slightly.\\n\\nThe babble broke out again.\\n\\n\"Yes, but he said we were really behind he wouldn\\'t listen --\"\\n\\n\"-- two rolls of parchment!\"\\n\\nProfessor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll speak to Professor Snape. You don\\'t have to do the\\nessay.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no,\" said Hermione, looking very disappointed. \"I\\'ve already\\nfinished it!\"\\n\\nThey had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought along a\\nglass box containing a hinkypunk, a little one-legged creature who\\nlooked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather frail and\\nharmless looking.\\n\\n\"Lures travelers into bogs,\" said Professor Lupin as they took notes.\\n\"You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead -people\\nfollow the light -- then --\"\\n\\nThe hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass.\\n\\nWhen the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and headed for the\\ndoor, Harry among them, but --\\n\\n\"Wait a moment, Harry,\" Lupin called. \"I\\'d like a word.\"\\n\\nHarry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the hinkypunk\\'s\\nbox with a cloth.\\n\\n\"I heard about the match,\" said Lupin, turning back to his desk and\\nstarting to pile books into his briefcase, \"and I\\'m sorry about your\\nbroomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"The tree smashed it to bits.\"\\n\\nLupin sighed.\\n\\n\"They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at\\nHogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch\\nthe trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye,\\nand we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.\"\\n\\n\"Did you hear about the dementors too?\" said Harry with difficulty.\\n\\nLupin looked at him quickly.\\n\\n\"Yes, I did. I don\\'t think any of us have seen Professor Dumbledore that\\nangry. They have been growing restless for some time -- furious at his\\nrefusal to let them inside the grounds.... I suppose they were the\\nreason you fell?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to ask\\nburst from him before he could stop himself.\" Why? Why do they affect me\\nlike that? Am I just --?\"\\n\\n\"It has nothing to do with weakness,\" said Professor Lupin sharply, as\\nthough he had read Harry\\'s mind. \"The dementors affect you worse than\\nthe others because there are horrors in your past that the others don\\'t\\nhave.\"\\n\\nA ray of wintery sunlight fell across the classroom, illuminating\\nLupin\\'s gray hairs and the lines on his young face.\\n\\n\"Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They\\ninfest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair,\\nthey drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them. Even\\nMuggles feel their presence, though they can\\'t see them. Get too near a\\ndementor and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out\\nof you. If it can, the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce\\nyou to something like itself... soul-less and evil. You\\'ll be left with\\nnothing but the worst experiences of your life. And the worst that\\nhappened to you, Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom.\\nYou have nothing to feel ashamed of.\"\\n\\n\"When they get near me --\" Harry stared at Lupin\\'s desk, his throat\\ntight. \"I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.\"\\n\\nLupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip Harry\\'s\\nshoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment\\'s Silence, then\\n--\\n\\n\"Why did they have to come to the match?\" said Harry bitterly.\\n\\n\"They\\'re getting hungry,\" said Lupin coolly, shutting his briefcase with\\na snap. \"Dumbledore won\\'t let them into the school, so their supply of\\nhuman prey has dried up.... I don\\'t think they could resist the large\\ncrowd around the Quidditch field. All that excitement ... emotions\\nrunning high... it was their idea of a feast.\"\\n\\n\"Azkaban must be terrible,\" Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.\\n\\n\"The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don\\'t\\nneed walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they\\'re all\\ntrapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheery thought.\\nMost of them go mad within weeks.\"\\n\\n\"But Sirius Black escaped from them,\" Harry said slowly. \"He got\\naway...\"\\n\\nLupin\\'s briefcase slipped from the desk; he had to stoop quickly to\\ncatch it.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he said, straightening up, \"Black must have found a way to fight\\nthem. I wouldn\\'t have believed it possible.... Dementors are supposed to\\ndrain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long....\"\\n\\n\"You made that dementor on the train back off,\" said Harry suddenly.\\n\\n\"There are -- certain defenses one can use,\" said Lupin. \"But there was\\nonly one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult\\nit becomes to resist.\"\\n\\n\"What defenses?\" said Harry at once. \"Can you teach me?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry, quite the\\ncontrary...\"\\n\\n\"But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need to be able\\nto fight them --\"\\n\\nLupin looked into Harry\\'s determined face, hesitated, then said,\\n\"Well... all right. I\\'ll try and help. But it\\'ll have to wait until next\\nterm, I\\'m afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very\\ninconvenient time to fall ill.\"\\n\\nWhat with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought\\nthat he might never have to hear his mother\\'s death again, and the fact\\nthat Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end\\nof November, Harry\\'s mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not\\nout of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose\\nanother match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked\\nhis team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into\\nDecember. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds.\\nDumbledore\\'s anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the\\nentrances.\\n\\nTwo weeks before the end of the term, the sky lightened suddenly to a\\ndazzling, opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning\\ncovered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, there was a buzz of\\nChristmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, had\\nalready decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out\\nto be real, fluttering fairies. The students were all happily discussing\\ntheir plans for the holidays. Both Ron and Hermione had decided to\\nremain at Hogwarts, and though Ron said it was because he couldn\\'t stand\\ntwo weeks with Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the\\nlibrary, Harry wasn\\'t fooled; they were doing it to keep him company,\\nand he was very grateful.\\n\\nTo everyone\\'s delight except Harry\\'s, there was to be another Hogsmeade\\ntrip on the very last weekend of the term.\\n\\n\"We can do all our Christmas shopping there!\" said Hermione. \"Mum and\\nDad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!\"\\n\\nResigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind\\nagain, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from Wood, and decided\\nto spend the day reading up on the different makes. He had been riding\\none of the school brooms at team practice, an ancient Shooting Star,\\nwhich was very slow and jerky; he definitely needed a new broom of his\\nown.\\n\\nOn the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid good-bye to Ron\\nand Hermione, who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves, then turned up the\\nmarble staircase alone, and headed back toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow\\nhad started to fall outside the windows, and the castle was very still\\nand quiet.\\n\\n\"Psst -- Harry!\"\\n\\nHe turned, halfway along the third-floor corridor, to see Fred and\\nGeorge peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked, one-eyed\\nwitch.\\n\\n\"What are you doing?\" said Harry curiously. \"How come you\\'re not going\\nto Hogsmeade?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,\" said Fred,\\nwith a mysterious wink. \"Come in here....\"\\n\\nHe nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the one-eyed statue.\\nHarry followed Fred and George inside. George closed the door quietly\\nand then turned, beaming, to look at Harry.\\n\\n\"Early Christmas present for you, Harry,\" he said.\\n\\nFred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it\\non one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of\\nparchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of Fred and\\nGeorge\\'s jokes, stared at it.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that supposed to be?\"\\n\\n\"This, Harry, is the secret of our success,\" said George, patting the\\nparchment fondly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a wrench, giving it to you,\" said Fred, \"but we decided last\\nnight, your need\\'s greater than ours.\"\\n\\n\"Anyway, we know it by heart,\" said George. \"We bequeath it to you. We\\ndon\\'t really need it anymore.\"\\n\\n\"And what do I need with a bit of old parchment?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"A bit of old parchment!\" said Fred, closing his eyes with a grimace as\\nthough Harry had mortally offended him. \"Explain, George.\"\\n\\n\"Well... when we were in our first year, Harry -- young, carefree, and\\ninnocent --\"\\n\\nHarry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever been\\ninnocent.\\n\\n\"Well, more innocent than we are now -- we got into a spot of bother\\nwith Filch.\"\\n\\n\"We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason\\n--\"\\n\\n\"So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the\\nusual --\" detention disembowelment and we couldn\\'t help noticing a\\ndrawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly\\nDangerous.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t tell me --\" said Harry, starting to grin.\\n\\n\"Well, what would you\\'ve done?\" said Fred. \"George caused a diversion by\\ndropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed --\\nthis.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not as bad as it sounds, you know,\" said George. \"We don\\'t reckon\\nFilch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was,\\nthough, or he wouldn\\'t have confiscated it.\"\\n\\n\"And you know how to work it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes,\" said Fred, smirking. \"This little beauty\\'s taught us more than\\nall the teachers in this school.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re winding me up,\" said Harry, looking at the ragged old bit of\\nparchment.\\n\\n\"Oh, are we?\" said George.\\n\\nHe took out his wand, touched the parchment lightly, and said, \"I\\nsolemnly swear that I am up to no good.\"\\n\\nAnd at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider\\'s web from the\\npoint that George\\'s wand had touched. They joined each other, they\\ncrisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parchment; then words\\nbegan to blossom across the top, great, curly green words, that\\nproclaimed:\\n\\nMessrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs\\n\\nPurveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers are proud to present THE\\nMARAUDER\\'S MAP\\n\\nIt was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and grounds.\\nBut the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it,\\neach labeled with a name in minuscule writing. Astounded, Harry bent\\nover it. A labeled dot in the top left corner showed that Professor\\nDumbledore was pacing his study; the caretaker\\'s cat, Mrs. Norris, was\\nprowling the second floor; and Peeves the Poltergeist was currently\\nbouncing around the trophy room. And as Harry\\'s eyes traveled up and\\ndown the familiar corridors, he noticed something else.\\n\\nThis map showed a set of passages he had never entered. And many of them\\nseemed to lead -\\n\\n\"Right into Hogsmeade,\" said Fred, tracing one of them with his finger.\\n\"There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four\" -- he\\npointed them out -- \"but we\\'re sure we\\'re the only ones who know about\\nthese. Don\\'t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor.\\nWe used it until last winter, but it\\'s caved in -- completely blocked.\\nAnd we don\\'t reckon anyone\\'s ever used this one, because the Whomping\\nWillow\\'s planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one\\nleads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We\\'ve used it loads of times.\\nAnd as you might\\'ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room,\\nthrough that one-eyed old crone\\'s hump.\"\\n\\n\"Moony, Wormtaill Padfoot, and Prongs,\" sighed George, patting the\\nheading of the map. \"We owe them so much.\"\\n\\n\"Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers,\"\\nsaid Fred solemnly.\\n\\n\"Right,\" said George briskly. \"Don\\'t forget to wipe it after you\\'ve used\\nit or anyone can read it,\" Fred said warningly.\\n\\n\"Just tap it again and say, \\'Mischief managed!\\' And it\\'ll go blank.\"\\n\\n\"So, young Harry,\" said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of Percy,\\n\"mind you behave yourself.\"\\n\\n\"See you in Honeydukes,\" said George, winking.\\n\\nThey left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way.\\n\\nHarry stood there, gazing at the miraculous map. He watched the tiny ink\\nMrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor. If\\nFilch really didn\\'t know... he wouldn\\'t have to pass the dementors at\\nall....\\n\\nBut even as he stood there, flooded with excitement, something Harry had\\nonce heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his memory.\\n\\nNever trust anything that can think for itself, if you can\\'t see where\\nit keeps its brain.\\n\\nThis map was one of those dangerous magical objects Mr. Weasley had been\\nwarning against.... Aids for Magical Mischief Makers... but then, Harry\\nreasoned, he only wanted to use it to get into Hogsmeade, it wasn\\'t as\\nthough he wanted to steal anything or attack anyone... and Fred and\\nGeorge had been using it for years without anything horrible\\nhappening....\\n\\nHarry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger.\\n\\nThen, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up the map,\\nstuffed it inside his robes, and hurried to the door of the classroom.\\nHe opened it a couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very\\ncarefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the\\none-eyed witch.\\n\\nWhat did he have to do? He pulled out the map again and saw to his\\nastonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, labeled Harry\\nPotter. This figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was\\nstanding, about halfway down the third-floor corridor.\\n\\nHarry watched carefully. His little Ink self appeared to be tapping the\\nwitch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real wand and\\ntapped the statue. Nothing happened. He looked back at the map. The\\ntiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure. The word inside\\nsaid, \"Dissendium.\"\\n\\n\"Dissendium!\" Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again.\\n\\nAt once, the statue\\'s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin\\nperson. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the\\nmap away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed\\nhimself forward.\\n\\nHe slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide, then\\nlanded on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was\\n\\npitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, \"Lumos! \" and saw that he was\\nin a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, tapped it\\nwith the tip of his wand, and muttered, \"Mischief managed!\" The map went\\nblank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his robes, then,\\nheart beating fast, both excited and apprehensive, he set off.\\n\\nThe passage twisted and turned, more like the burrow of a giant rabbit\\nthan anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now and then on\\nthe uneven floor, holding his wand out in front of him.\\n\\nIt took ages, but Harry had the thought of Honeydukes to sustain him.\\nAfter what felt like an hour, the passage began to rise. Panting, Harry\\nsped up, his face hot, his feet very cold.\\n\\nTen minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, which\\nrose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, Harry began\\nto climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost count as he\\nclimbed, watching his feet.... Then, without warning, his head hit\\nsomething hard.\\n\\nIt seemed to be a trapdoor. Harry stood there, massaging the top of his\\nhead, listening. He couldn\\'t hear any sounds above him. Very slowly, he\\npushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge.\\n\\nHe was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates and boxes. Harry\\nclimbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it -- it blended so perfectly\\nwith the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there. Harry\\ncrept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs. Now he could\\ndefinitely hear voices, not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the\\nopening and shutting of a door.\\n\\nWondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open much closer\\nat hand; somebody was about to come downstairs.\\n\\n\"And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they\\'ve nearly cleaned us out\\n--\" said a woman\\'s voice.\\n\\nA pair of feet was coming down the staircase. Harry leapt behind an\\nenormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard the man\\nshifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get another\\nchance --\\n\\nQuickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed\\nthe stairs; looking back, he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald\\nhead, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs,\\nslipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes\\n-- he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.\\n\\nHoneydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts students that no one looked\\ntwice at Harry. He edged among them, looking around, and suppressed a\\nlaugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley\\'s piggy face\\nif he could see where Harry was now.\\n\\nThere were shelves upon shelves of the most succulent-looking sweets\\nimaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink squares of coconut\\nice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds of different kinds of\\nchocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans,\\nand another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitating sherbert balls that Ron\\nhad mentioned; along yet another wall were \"Special Effects\" -- sweets:\\nDroobles Best Blowing Gum (which filled a room with bluebell-colored\\nbubbles that refused to pop for days), the strange, splintery\\nToothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\"breathe fire for\\nyour friends!\"), Ice Mice (\"hear your teeth chatter and squeak!\"),\\npeppermint creams shaped like toads (\"hop realistically in the\\nstomach!\"), fragile sugar-spun quills, and exploding bonbons.\\n\\nHarry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign\\nhanging in the farthest corner of the shop (UNUSUAL TASTES). Ron and\\nHermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray of blood-flavored\\nlollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them.\\n\\n\"Ugh, no, Harry won\\'t want one of those, they\\'re for vampires, I\\nexpect,\" Hermione was saying.\\n\\n\"How about these?\" said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clusters under\\nHermione\\'s nose.\\n\\n\"Definitely not,\" said Harry.\\n\\nRon nearly dropped the jar.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" squealed Hermione. \"What are you doing here? How -- how did you\\n--?\"\\n\\n\"Wow!\" said Ron, looking very impressed, \"you\\'ve learned to Apparate!\"\\n\\n\"\\'Course I haven\\'t,\" said Harry. He dropped his voice so that none of\\nthe sixth years could hear him and told them all about the Marauder\\'s\\nMap.\\n\\n\"How come Fred and George never gave it to me!\" said Ron, outraged. \"I\\'m\\ntheir brother!\"\\n\\n\"But Harry isn\\'t going to keep it!\" said Hermione, as though the idea\\nwere ludicrous. \"He\\'s going to hand it in to Professor McGonagall,\\naren\\'t you, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m not!\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Are you mad?\" said Ron, goggling at Hermione. \"Hand in something that\\ngood?\"\\n\\n\"If I hand it in, I\\'ll have to say where I got it! Filch would know Fred\\nand George had nicked it!\"\\n\\n\"But what about Sirius Black?\" Hermione hissed. \"He could be using one\\nof the passages on that map to get into the castle! The teachers have\\ngot to know!\"\\n\\n\"He can\\'t be getting in through a passage,\" said Harry quickly. \"There\\nare seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George reckon Filch\\nalready knows about four of them. And of the other three -- one of\\nthem\\'s caved in, so no one can get through it. one of them\\'s got the\\nWhomping Willow planted over the entrance, so you can\\'t get out of it.\\nAnd the one I just came through -well - - it\\'s really hard to see the\\nentrance to it down in the cellar, so unless he knew it was there...\"\\n\\nHarry hesistated. What if Black did know the passage was there?\\n\\nRon, however, cleared his throat significantly, and pointed to a notice\\npasted on the inside of the sweetshop door.\\n\\n--------BY ORDER OF -------- THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC\\n\\nCustomers are reminded that until further notice, dementors will be\\npatrolling the streets of Hogsmeade every night after sundown. This\\nmeasure has been put in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and\\nwill be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is therefore\\nadvisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall.\\n\\nMerry Christmas!\\n\\n\"See?\" said Ron quietly. \"I\\'d like to see Black try and break into\\nHoneydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Anyway,\\nHermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, wouldn\\'t they?\\nThey live over the shop!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but but --\" Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find another\\nproblem. \"Look, Harry still shouldn\\'t be coming into Hogsmeade. He\\nhasn\\'t got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he\\'ll be in so much\\ntrouble! And it\\'s not nightfall yet -- what if Sirius Black turns up\\ntoday? Now?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'d have a job spotting Harry in this,\" said Ron, nodding through the\\nmullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. \"Come on, Hermione, it\\'s\\nChristmas. Harry deserves a break.\"\\n\\nHermione bit her lip, looking extremely worried.\\n\\n\"Are you going to report me?\" Harry asked her, grinning.\\n\\n\"Oh -- of course not -- but honestly, Harry --\"\\n\\n\"Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry?\" said Ron, grabbing him and leading\\nhim over to their barrel. \"And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred\\ngave me one of those when I was seven -- it burnt a hole right through\\nmy tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick.\" Ron stared\\nbroodingly into the Acid Pop box. \"Reckon Fred\\'d take a bit of Cockroach\\nCluster if I told him they were peanuts?\"\\n\\nWhen Ron and Hermione had paid for all their sweets, the three of them\\nleft Honeydukes for the blizzard outside.\\n\\nHogsmeade looked like a Christmas card; the little thatched cottages and\\nshops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were holly\\nwreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the\\ntrees.\\n\\nHarry shivered; unlike the other two, he didn\\'t have his cloak. They\\nheaded up the street, heads bowed against the wind, Ron and Hermione\\nshouting through their scarves.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the post office\\n\\n\"Zonko\\'s is up there --\"\\n\\n\"We could go up to the Shrieking Shack\\n\\n\"Tell you what,\" said Ron, his teeth chattering, \"shall we go for a\\nbutterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?\"\\n\\nHarry was more than willing; the wind was fierce and his hands were\\nfreezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were entering\\nthe tiny inn.\\n\\nIt was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort of woman\\nwith a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlock\\' up at the bar.\\n\\n\"That\\'s Madam Rosmerta,\" said Ron. \"I\\'ll get the drinks, shall I?\" he\\nadded, going slightly red.\\n\\nHarry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, ,,her, there\\nwas a small, vacant table between the window and a handsome Christmas\\ntree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron came back five minutes\\nlater, carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer.\\n\\n\"Merry Christmas!\" he said happily, raising his tankard.\\n\\nHarry drank deeply. It was the most delicious thing he\\'d ever tasted and\\nseemed to heat every bit of him from the inside.\\n\\nA sudden breeze ruffled his hair. The door of the Three Broomsticks had\\nopened again. Harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked.\\n\\nProfessors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub with a\\nflurry of snowflakes, shortly followed by Hagrid, who was deep in\\nconversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat and a\\npinstriped cloak -- Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.\\n\\nIn an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the top of\\nHarry\\'s head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping\\nwith butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched his empty\\ntankard and watched the teachers\\' and Fudge\\'s feet move toward the bar,\\npause, then turn and walk right toward him.\\n\\nSomewhere above him, Hermione whispered, Mobiliarbus!\"\\n\\nThe Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground,\\ndrifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in front of their\\ntable, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches,\\nHarry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside\\ntheirs, then heard the grunts and sighs If the teachers and minister as\\nthey sat down.\\n\\nNext he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels,\\nand heard a woman\\'s voice. \"A small gillywater --\"\\n\\n\"Mine,\" said Professor McGonagall\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"Four pints of mulled mead --\"\\n\\n\"Ta, Rosmerta,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella --\"\\n\\n\"Mmm!\" said Professor Flitwick, smacking his lips.\\n\\n\"So you\\'ll be the red currant rum, Minister.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Rosmerta, m\\'dear,\" said Fudge\\'s voice. \"Lovely to see you\\nagain, I must say. Have one yourself, won\\'t you? Come and join us....\"\\n\\n\"Well, thank you very much, Minister.\"\\n\\nHarry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. His heart\\nwas pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn\\'t it occurred to him\\nthat this was the last weekend of term for the teachers to& And how long\\nwere they going to sit there? He needed time to sneak back into\\nHoneydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight.... Hermione\\'s leg\\ngave a nervous twitch next to him.\\n\\n\"So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Minister?\" came Madam\\nRosmerta\\'s voice.\\n\\nHarry saw the lower part of Fudge\\'s thick body twist in his chair as\\nthough he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a quiet\\nvoice, \"What else, m\\'dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you heard what\\nhappened up at the school at Halloween?\"\\n\\nI did hear a rumor,\" admitted Madam Rosmerta.\\n\\n\"Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?\" said Professor McGonagall\\nexasperatedly.\\n\\n\"Do you think Blacks still in the area, Minister?\" whispered Madam\\nRosmerta.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure of it,\" said Fudge shortly.\\n\\n\"You know that the dementors have searched the whole village twjce?\"\\nsaid Madam Rosmerta, a slight edge to her voice. \"Scared all my\\ncustomers away... It\\'s very bad for business, Minister.\"\\n\\n\"Rosmerta, dear, I don\\'t like them any more than you do,\" said Fudge\\nuncomfortably. \"Necessary precaution... unfortunate, but there YOU\\nare.... I\\'ve just met some of them. They\\'re in a fury against Dumbledore\\n-- he won\\'t let them inside the castle grounds.\"\\n\\n\"I should think not,\" said Professor McGonagall sharply. \"How are we\\nsupposed to teach with those horrors floating around?\"\\n\\n\"Hear, hear!\" squeaked tiny Professor Flitwick, whose feet were dangling\\na foot from the ground.\\n\\n\"All the same,\" demurred Fudge, \"they are here to protect you all from\\nsomething much worse.... We all know what Black\\'s capable of...\"\\n\\n\"Do you know, I still have trouble believing it,\" said Madam Rosmerta\\nthoughtfully. \"Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius\\nBlack was the last I\\'d have thought... I mean, I remember him when he\\nwas a boy at Hogwarts. If you\\'d told me then what he was going to\\nbecome, I\\'d have said you\\'d had too much mead.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know the half of it, Rosmerta,\" said Fudge gruffly. \"The\\nworst he did isn\\'t widely known.\"\\n\\n\"The worst?\" said Madam Rosmerta, her voice alive with curiosity, \"Worse\\nthan murdering all those poor people, you mean?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly do,\" said Fudge.\\n\\n\"I ca\\'A believe that. What could possibly be worse?\" \"You say you\\nremember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,\" mur- mured Professor McGonagall.\\n\"Do you remember who his-best friend was?\"\\n\\n\"Naturally,\" said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. \"Never saw one\\nwithout the other, did you? The number of times I had them in here --\\nooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the double act, Sirius Black and\\nJames Potter!\"\\n\\nHarry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him.\\n\\n\"Precisely,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Black and Potter. Ringleaders\\nof their little gang. Both very bright, of course -- exceptionally\\nbright, in fact -- but I don\\'t think we\\'ve ever had such a pair of\\ntroublemakers --\"\\n\\n\"I dunno,\" chuckled Hagrid. \"Fred and George Weasley could give \\'em a\\nrun fer their money.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'d have thought Black and Potter were brothers!\" chimed in Professor\\nFlitwick. \"Inseparable!\"\\n\\n\"Of course they were,\" said Fudge. \"Potter trusted Black beyond all his\\nother friends. Nothing changed when they left school. Black was best man\\nwhen James married Lily. Then they named him godfather to Harry. Harry\\nhas no idea, of course. You can imagine how the idea would torment him.\"\\n\\n\"Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-Who?\" whispered\\nMadam Rosmerta.\\n\\n\"Worse even than that, rn\\'dear....\" Fudge dropped his voice and\\nproceeded in a sort of low rumble. \"Not many people are aware that the\\nPotters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, who was of course\\nworking tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a number of useful spies.\\nOne of them tipped him off, and he alerted James and Lily at once. He\\nadvised them to go into hiding. Well, of course, You-Know-Who wasn\\'t an\\neasy person to hide from. Dumbledore told them that their best chance\\nwas the Fidelius Charm.\"\\n\\n\"How does that work?\" said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with interest.\\nProfessor Flitwick cleared his throat.\\n\\n\"An immensely complex spell,\" he said squeakily, \"involving the magical\\nconcealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The information is\\nhidden inside the chosen person, or Secret-Keeper, and is henceforth\\nimpossible to find -- unless, of course, the Secret-Keeper chooses to\\ndivulge it. As long as the Secret-Keeper refused to speak, You-Know-Who\\ncould search the village where Lily and James were staying for years and\\nnever find them, not even if he had his nose pressed against their\\nsitting room window!\"\\n\\n\"So Black was the Potters\\' Secret-Keeper?\" whispered Madam Rosmerta.\\n\\n\"Naturally,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"James Potter told Dumbledore\\nthat Black would die rather than tell where they were, that Black was\\nplanning to go into hiding himself... and yet, Dumbledore remained\\nworried. I remember him offering to be the Potters\\' Secret-Keeper\\nhimself.\"\\n\\n\"He suspected Black?\" gasped Madam Rosmerta.\\n\\n\"He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keeping\\nYou-Know-Who informed of their movements,\" said Professor McGonagall\\ndarkly. \"Indeed, he had suspected for some time that someone on our side\\nhad turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to\\nYou-Know-Who.\"\\n\\n\"But James Potter insisted on using Black?\"\\n\\n\"He did,\" said Fudge heavily. \"And then, barely a week after the\\nFidelius Charm had been performed --\" \"Black betrayed them?\" breathed\\nMadam Rosmerta.\\n\\n\"He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was ready\\nto declare his support openly for You-Know-Who, and he seems to have\\nplanned this for the moment of the Potters\\' death. But, as we all know,\\nYou-Know-Who met his downfall in little Harry Potter. Powers gone,\\nhorribly weakened, he fled. And this left Black in a very nasty position\\nindeed. His master had fallen at the very moment when he, Black, had\\nshown his true colors as a traitor. He had no choice but to run for it\\n--\"\\n\\n\"Filthy, stinkin\\' turncoat!\" Hagrid said, so loudly that half the bar\\nwent quiet.\\n\\n\"Shh!\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n\\n\"I met him!\" growled Hagrid. \"I musta bin the last ter see him before he\\nkilled all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an\\'\\nJames\\'s house after they was killed! jus\\' got him outta the ruins, poor\\nlittle thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an\\' his parents\\ndead... an\\' Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin\\' motorbike he used ter\\nride. Never occurred ter me what he was doin\\' there. I didn\\' know he\\'d\\nbin Lily an\\' James\\'s Secret-Keeper. Thought he\\'d jus\\' heard the news o\\'\\nYou-Know-Who\\'s attack an\\' come ter see what he could do. White an\\'\\nshakin\\', he was. An\\' yeh know what I did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN\\'\\nTRAITOR!\" Hagrid roared.\\n\\n\"Hagrid, please!\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Keep your voice down!\"\\n\\n\"How was I ter know he wasn\\' upset abou\\' Lily an\\' James? It was\\nYou-Know-Who he cared abou\\'! An\\' then he says, \\'Give Harry ter me,\\nHagrid, I\\'m his godfather, I\\'ll look after him --\\' Ha! But I\\'d had me\\norders from Dumbledore, an\\' I told Black no, Dumbledore said Harry was\\nter go ter his aunt an\\' uncle\\'s. Black argued, but in the end he gave\\nin. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry there. \\'I won\\'t need it\\nanymore,\\' he says.\\n\\n\"I shoulda known there was somethin\\' fishy goin\\' on then. He loved that\\nmotorbike, what was he givin\\' it ter me for? Why wouldn\\' he need it\\nanymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. Dumbledore knew he\\'d bin\\nthe Potters\\' Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin\\' ter have ter run fer\\nit that night, knew it was a matter o\\' hours before the Ministry was\\nafter him.\\n\\n\"But what if I\\'d given Harry to him, eh? I bet he\\'d \\'ve pitched him off\\nthe bike halfway out ter sea. His bes\\' friends\\' son! But when a wizard\\ngoes over ter the Dark Side, there\\'s nothin\\' and no one that matters to\\nem anymore....\"\\n\\nA long silence followed Hagrid\\'s story. Then Madam Rosmerta said with\\nsome satisfaction, \"But he didn\\'t manage to disappear, did he? The\\nMinistry of Magic caught up with him next day!\"\\n\\n\"Alas, if only we had,\" said Fudge bitterly. \"It was not we who found\\nhim. It was little Peter Pettigrew -- another of the Potters\\' friends.\\nMaddened by grief, no doubt, and knowing that Black had been the\\nPotters\\' Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.\"\\n\\n\"Pettigrew... that fat little boy who was always tagging around after\\nthem at Hogwarts?\" said Madam Rosmerta.\\n\\n\"Hero-worshipped Black and Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Never\\nquite in their league, talent-wise. I was often rather ,harp with him.\\nYou can imagine how I -how I regret that now...\" She sounded as though\\nshe had a sudden head cold.\\n\\n\"There, now, Minerva,\" said Fudge kindly, \"Pettigrew died a hero\\'s\\ndeath. Eyewitnesses -- Muggles, of course, we wiped their, memories\\nlater -- told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say he was sobbing,\\n\\'Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?\\' And then he went for his wand.\\nWell, of course, Black was quicker. Blew Pettigrew to smithereens....\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall blew her nose and said thickly, \"Stupid boy ...\\nfoolish boy... he was always hopeless at dueling... should have left it\\nto the Ministry....\"\\n\\n\"I tell yeh, if I\\'d got ter Black before little Pettigrew did, I\\nwouldn\\'t \\'ve messed around with wands -- I\\'d \\'ve ripped him limb -- from\\n-- limb,\" Hagrid growled.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about, Hagrid,\" said Fudge sharply.\\n\"Nobody but trained Hit Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad\\nwould have stood a chance against Black once he was cornered. I was\\nJunior Minister in the Department of Magical Catastrophes at the time,\\nand I was one of the first on the scene after Black murdered all those\\npeople. I -- I will never forget it. I still dream about it sometimes. A\\ncrater in the middle of the street, so deep it had cracked the sewer\\nbelow. Bodies everywhere. Muggles screaming. And Black standing there\\nlaughing, with what was left of Pettigrew in front of him... a heap of\\nbloodstained robes and a few -- a few fragments --\"\\n\\nFudge\\'s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five noses being\\nblown.\\n\\n\"Well, there you have it, Rosmerta,\" said Fudge thickly. \"Black was\\ntaken away by twenty members of the Magical Law Enforcement \\'Squad and\\nPettigrew received the Order of Merlin, First Class, which I think was\\nsome comfort to his poor mother. Blades been in Azkaban ever since.\"\\n\\nMadam Rosmerta let out a long sigh.\\n\\n\"Is it true he\\'s mad, Minister?\"\\n\\n\"I wish I could say that he was,\" said Fudge slowly. \"I certainly\\nbelieve his master\\'s defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of\\nPettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and\\ndesperate man -- cruel... pointless. Yet I met Black on my last\\ninspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there sit\\nmuttering to themselves in the dark; there\\'s no sense in them... but I\\nwas shocked at how normal Black seemed. He spoke quite rationally to me.\\nIt was unnerving. You\\'d have thought he was merely bored -- asked if I\\'d\\nfinished with my newspaper, cool as you please, said he missed doing the\\ncrossword. Yes, I was astounded at how little effect the dementors\\nseemed to be having on him -- and he was one of the most heavily guarded\\nin the place, you know. Dementors outside his door day and night.\"\\n\\n\"But what do you think he\\'s broken out to do?\" said Madam Rosmerta.\\n\"Good gracious, Minister, he isn\\'t trying to rejoin You-Know-Who, is\\nhe?\"\\n\\nI daresay that is his -- er -- eventual plan,\" said Fudge evasively.\\n\"But we hope to catch Black long before that. I must say, You-Know-Who\\nalone and friendless is one thing... but give him back his most devoted\\nservant, and I shudder to think how quickly he\\'ll rise again....\"\\n\\nThere was a small chink of glass on wood. Someone had set down their\\nglass.\\n\\n\"You know, Cornelius, if you\\'re dining with the headmaster, he\\'d better\\nhead back up to the castle,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n\\nOne by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of their\\nowners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and Madam Rosemerta\\'s\\nglittering heels disappeared behind the bar. The door of the Three\\nBroomsticks opened again, there was another flurry of snow, and the\\nteachers had disappeared.\\n\\n\"Harry?\"\\n\\nRon\\'s and Hermione\\'s faces appeared under the table. They were both\\nstaring at him, lost for words.\\n\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\\n\\nTHE FIREBOLT\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back\\ninto the Honeydukes cellar, through the tunnel, and into the castle once\\nmore. All he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at\\nall, and that he hardly noticed what he was doing, because his head was\\nstill pounding with the conversation he had just heard.\\n\\nWhy had nobody ever told him? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. Weasley, Cornelius\\nFudge... why hadn\\'t anyone ever mentioned the fact that Harry\\'s parents\\nhad died because their best friend had betrayed them?\\n\\nRon and Herinione watched Harry nervously all through dintier, not\\ndaring to talk about what they\\'d overheard, because Percy was sitting\\nclose by them. When they went upstairs to the crowded common room, it\\nwas to find Fred and George had set off half a dozen Dungbombs in a fit\\nof end- of-term high spirits. Harry, who didn\\'t want Fred and George\\nasking him whether he\\'d reached Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietly up to\\nthe empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet. He\\npushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for -- the\\nleather-bound photo album Hagrid had given him two years ago, which was\\nfull of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his\\nbed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages,\\nsearching, until...\\n\\nHe stopped on a picture of his parents\\' wedding day. There was his\\nfather waving up at him, beaming, the untidy black hair Harry had\\ninherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, alight\\nwith happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there ... that must be him.\\nTheir best man... Harry had never given him a thought before.\\n\\nIf he hadn\\'t known it was the same person, he would never have guessed\\nit was Black in this old photograph. His face wasn\\'t sunken and waxy,\\nbut handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been working for\\nVoldemort when this picture had been taken? Was he already planning the\\ndeaths of the two people next to him? Did he realize he was facing\\ntwelve years in Azkaban, twelve years that would make him\\nunrecognizable?\\n\\nBut the dementors don\\'t affect him, Harry thought, staring into the\\nhandsome, laughing face. He doesn\\'t have to hear my Min screaming if\\nthey get too close -\\n\\nHarry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back into his\\ncabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, making sure the\\nhangings were hiding him from view.\\n\\nThe dormitory door opened.\\n\\n\"Harry?\" said Ron\\'s voice uncertainly.\\n\\nBut Harry still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave again, and\\nrolled over on his back, his eyes wide open.\\n\\nA hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through Harry\\nlike poison. He could see Black laughing at him through the darkness, as\\nthough somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes. He\\nwatched, as though somebody was playing him a piece of film, Sirius\\nBlack blasting Peter Pettigrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a\\nthousand pieces. He could hear (though having no idea what Black\\'s voice\\nmight sound like) a low, excited mutter. \"It has happened, My Lord...\\nthe Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper and then came another\\nvoice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that Harry heard inside his head\\nwhenever the dementors drew near....\\n\\n\"Harry, you -- you look terrible.\"\\n\\nHarry hadn\\'t gotten to sleep until daybreak. He had awoken to find the\\ndormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral staircase to a\\ncommon room that was completely empty except for Ron, who was eating a\\nPeppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and Hermione, who had spread\\nher homework over three tables.\\n\\n\"Where is everyone?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Gone! It\\'s the first day of the holidays, remember?\" said Ron, watching\\nHarry closely. \"It\\'s nearly lunchtime; I was going to come and wake you\\nup in a minute.\"\\n\\nHarry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling\\noutside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire\\nlike a large, ginger rug.\\n\\n\"You really don\\' look well, you know,\" Hermione said, peering anxiously\\ninto his face.\\n\\n\"I\\'m fine,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Harry, listen,\" said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, you must be\\nreally upset about what we heard yesterday. But the thing is, you\\nmustn\\'t go doing anything stupid.\"\\n\\n\"Like what?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Like trying to go after Black,\" said Ron sharply.\\n\\nHarry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been\\nasleep. He didn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t, will you, Harry?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Because Black\\'s not worth dying for,\" said Ron.\\n\\nHarry looked at them. They didn\\'t seem to understand at all.\\n\\n\"D\\'you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me?\"\\nRon and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive. \"I can hear my\\nmum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you\\'d heard your mum\\nscreaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn\\'t forget it in\\na hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of\\nhers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her --\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing you can do!\" said Hermione, looking stricken. \"The\\ndementors will catch Black and he\\'ll go back to Azkaban and -- and serve\\nhim right!\"\\n\\n\"You heard what Fudge said. Black isn\\'t affected by Azkaban like normal\\npeople are. It\\'s not a punishment for him like it is for the others.\"\\n\\n\"So what are you saying?\" said Ron, looking very tense. \"You want to --\\nto kill Black or something?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be silly,\" said Herinione in a panicky voice. \"Harry doesn\\'t want\\nto kill anyone, do you, Harry?\"\\n\\nAgain, Harry didn\\'t answer. He didn\\'t know what he wanted to do. All he\\nknew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was\\nalmost more than he could stand.\\n\\nMalfoy knows,\" he said abruptly. \"Remember what he said to me in\\nPotions? \\'If it was me, I\\'d hunt him down myself... I\\'d want revenge.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to take Malfoy\\'s advice instead of ours?\" said Ron\\nfuriously. \"Listen... you know what Pettigrew\\'s mother got back after\\nBlack had finished with him? Dad told me -- the Order of Merlin, First\\nClass, and Pettigrew\\'s finger in a box. That was the biggest bit of him\\nthey could find. Black\\'s a madman, Harry, and he\\'s dangerous --\"\\n\\n\"Malfoy\\'s dad must have told him,\" said Harry, ignoring Ron. \"He was\\nright in Voldemort\\'s inner circle --\"\\n\\n\"Say You-Know-Who, will you?\" interjected Ron angrily.\\n\\n\"-- so obviously, the Malfoys knew Black was working for Voldemort --\"\\n\\n\"-- and Malfoy\\'d love to see you blown into about a million pieces, like\\nPettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy\\'s just hoping you\\'ll get Yourself killed\\nbefore he has to play you at Quidditch.\"\\n\\n\"Harry, please,\" said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, \"Please\\nbe sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don\\'t Put\\nYourself in danger, it\\'s what Black wants.... Oh, Harry, you\\'d be\\nPlaying right into Black\\'s hands if you went looking for him. Your mum\\nand dad wouldn\\'t want you to get hurt, would they? They\\'d never want you\\nto go looking for Black!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll never know what they\\'d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I\\'ve\\nnever spoken to them,\" said Harry shortly.\\n\\nThere was a silence in which Crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing\\nhis claws. Ron\\'s pocket quivered.\\n\\n\"Look,\" said Ron, obviously casting around for a change of subject,\\n\"it\\'s the holidays! It\\'s nearly Christmas! Let\\'s -- let\\'s go down and\\nsee Hagrid. We haven\\'t visited him for ages!\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Hermione quickly. \"Harry isn\\'t supposed to leave the castle,\\nRon --\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, let\\'s go,\" said Harry, sitting up, \"and I can ask him how come he\\nnever mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!\"\\n\\nFurther discussion of Sirius Black plainly wasn\\'t what Ron had had in\\nmind.\\n\\n\"Or we could have a game of chess, he said hastily, \"or Gobstones. Percy\\nleft a set --\"\\n\\n\"No, let\\'s visit Hagrid,\" said Harry firmly.\\n\\nSo they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the\\nportrait hole (\"Stand and fight, you yellow-bellied mongrels!\"), down\\nthrough the empty castle and out through the oak front doors.\\n\\nThey made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow trench in the\\nglittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of their cloaks\\nsoaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as though it had been\\nenchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and Hagrid\\'s cabin looked\\nlike an iced cake.\\n\\nRon knocked, but there was no answer.\\n\\n\"He\\'s not out, is he?\" said Hermione, who was shivering under her cloak.\\n\\nRon had his ear to the door.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a weird noise,\" he said. \"Listen -- is that Fang?\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside the cabin\\ncame a series of low, throbbing moans.\\n\\n\"Think we\\'d better go and get someone?\" said Ron nervously.\\n\\n\"Hagrid!\" called Harry, thumping the door. \"Hagrid, are you in there.\\n\\nThere was a sound of heavy footsteps, then the door creaked open. Hagrid\\nstood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears splashing down the\\nfront of his leather vest.\\n\\n\"YWve heard?\" he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry\\'s neck.\\n\\nHagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no\\nlaughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid\\'s weight, was\\nrescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under an arm and\\nheaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed himself to be steered\\ninto a chair and slumped over the table, sobbing uncontrollably, his\\nface glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard.\\n\\n\"Hagrid, what is it?\" said Hermione, aghast.\\n\\nHarry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table.\\n\\n\"What\\'s this, Hagrid?\"\\n\\nHagrid\\'s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, who\\nPicked it up and read aloud:\\n\\nDear Mr. Hagrid,\\n\\nFurther to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in\\nyour class, we have accepted the assurances of Professor Dumbledore that\\nyou bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident.\\n\\n\"Well, that\\'s okay then, Hagrid!\" said Ron, clapping Hagrid oil the\\nshoulder. But Hagrid continued to sob, and waved one of his gigantic\\nhands, inviting Harry to read on.\\n\\nHowever, we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question.\\nWe have decided to uphold the official complaint of Mr. Lucius Malfoy,\\nand this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the\\nDisposal of Dangerous Creatures. The hearing will take place on April\\n20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the\\nCommittee\\'s offices in London on that date. In the meantime, the\\nhippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. Yours in fellowship...\\n\\nThere followed a list of the school governors.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Ron. \"But you said Buckbeak isn\\'t a bad hippogriff, Hagrid. I\\nbet he\\'ll get off\\n\\n\"Yeh don\\' know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Disposal o\\'\\nDangerous Creatures!\" choked Hagrid, wiping his eyes on his sleeve.\\n\"They\\'ve got it in fer interestin\\' creatures!\"\\n\\nA sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid\\'s cabin made Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner,\\nchomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\' leave him tied up out there in the snow!\" choked Hagrid. \"All\\non his own! At Christmas.\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had never seen eye\\nto eye with Hagrid about what he called \"interesting creatures\" and\\nother people called \"terrifying monsters.\" Or\\' the other hand, there\\ndidn\\'t seem to be any particular harm in Buckbeak. In fact, by Hagrid\\'s\\nusual standards, he was positively cute.\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid,\" said Hermione,\\nsitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid\\'s massive forearm. \"I\\'m sure\\nyou can prove Buckbeak is safe.\"\\n\\n\"Won\\'t make no diff\\'rence!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"Them Disposal devils,\\nthey\\'re all in Lucius Malfoy\\'s pocket! Scared o\\' him! Ad if I lose the\\ncase, Buckbeak --\"\\n\\nHagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great wail\\nand lurched forward, his face in his arms.\\n\\n\"What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"He\\'s done more\\'n enough fer me already,\" groaned Hagrid. \"Got enough on\\nhis plate what with keepin\\' them dementors outta the castle, an\\' Sirius\\nBlack lurkin\\' around --\"\\n\\nRon and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to\\nstart berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black. But\\nHarry couldn\\'t bring himself to do it, not now that he saw Hagrid so\\nmiserable and scared.\\n\\n\"Listen, Hagrid,\" he said, \"you can\\'t give up. Hermione\\'s right, You\\njust need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses --\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure I\\'ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,\" said Hermione\\nthoughtfully, \"where the hippogriff got off I\\'ll look it up for you,\\nHagrid, and see exactly what happened.\"\\n\\nHagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at Ron to\\nhelp them.\\n\\n\"Er -- shall I make a cup of tea?\" said Ron.\\n\\nHarry stared at him.\\n\\n\"It\\'s what my mum does whenever someone\\'s upset,\" Ron muttered,\\nshrugging.\\n\\nAt last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug of tea\\nin front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a\\ntablecloth and said, \"Yer right. I can\\' afford to go ter pieces. Gotta\\npull meself together.....\\n\\nFang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his\\nhead on Hagrid\\'s knee.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve not bin meself lately,\" said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one hand\\nand mopping his face with the other. \"Worried abou\\' Buckbeak, an\\' no one\\nlikin\\' me classes --\"\\n\\n\"We do like them!\" lied Hermione at once.\\n\\n\"Yeah, they\\'re great!\" said Ron, crossing his fingers under the table.\\n\"Er -- how are the flobberworms?\"\\n\\n\"Dead,\" said Hagrid gloomily. \"Too much lettuce.\"\\n\\n\"Oh no!\" said Ron, his lip twitching.\\n\\n\"An\\' them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an\\' all,\" said Hagrid,\\nwith a sudden shudder. \"Gotta walk past \\'em ev\\'ry time I want a drink in\\nthe Three Broomsticks. \\'S like bein\\' back in Azkaban --\"\\n\\nHe fell silent, gulping his tea. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watched him\\nbreathlessly. They had never heard Hagrid talk about his brief spell in\\nAzkaban before. After a pause, Hermione said timidly, \"Is it awful in\\nthere, Hagrid?\"\\n\\n\"Yeh\\'ve no idea,\" said Hagrid quietly. \"Never bin anywhere like it.\\nThought I was goin\\' mad. Kep\\' goin\\' over horrible stuff in me mind...\\nthe day I got expelled from Hogwarts... day me dad died... day I had ter\\nlet Norbert go....\"\\n\\nHis eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid had once\\nwon in a game of cards.\\n\\n\"Yeh can\\' really remember who yeh are after a while. An\\' yeh can\\' really\\nsee the point o\\' livin\\' at all. I used ter hope I\\'d jus\\' die in me\\nsleep. When they let me out, it was like bein\\' born again, ev\\'rythin\\' I\\ncame floodin\\' back, it was the bes\\' feelin\\' in the world. Mind, the\\ndementors weren\\'t keen on lettin\\' me go.\"\\n\\n\"But you were innocent!\" said Hermione.\\n\\nHagrid snorted.\\n\\n\"Think that matters to them? They don\\' care. Long as they\\'ve got a\\ncouple o\\' hundred humans stuck there with \\'em, so they can leech all the\\nhappiness out of \\'em, they don\\' give a damn who\\'s guilty an\\' who\\'s not.\"\\n\\nHagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he said\\nquietly, \"Thought o\\' jus\\' letting Buckbeak go... tryin\\' ter make him fly\\naway... but how d\\'yeh explain ter a hippogriff it\\'s gotta go inter\\nhidin\\'? An\\' -an\\' I\\'m scared o\\' breakin\\' the law....\" He looked up at\\nthem, tears leaking down his face again. \"I don\\' ever want ter go back\\nter Azkaban.\"\\n\\nThe trip to Hagrid\\'s, though far from fun, had nevertheless had the\\neffect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no means\\nforgotten about Black, he couldn\\'t brood constantly on revenge if he\\nwanted to help Hagrid win his case against the Committee for the\\nDisposal of Dangerous Creatures. He, Ron, and Hermione went to the\\nlibrary the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with\\nbooks that might help prepare a defense for Buckbeak. The three of them\\nsat in front of the roaring fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty\\nvolumes about famous cases If marauding beasts, speaking occasionally\\nwhen they ran across something relevant.\\n\\n\"Here\\'s something... there was a case in 1722... but the hippogriff was\\nconvicted -- ugh, look what they did to it, that\\'s disgusting --\"\\n\\n\"This might help, look -- a manticore savaged someone in 1296, and they\\nlet the manticore off -- oh -- no, that was only because everyone was\\ntoo scared to go near it.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent Christmas\\ndecorations had been put up, despite the fact that hardly any of the\\nstudents remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of holly and mistletoe\\nwere strung along the corridors, mysterious lights shone from inside\\nevery suit of armor, and the Great Hall was filled with its usual twelve\\nChristmas trees, glittering with golden stars. A powerful and delicious\\nsmell of cooking pervaded the corridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had\\ngrown so strong that even Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of\\nRon\\'s pocket to sniff hopefully at the air.\\n\\nOn Christmas morning, Harry was woken by Ron throwing his pillow at him.\\n\\n\"Oy! Presents!\"\\n\\nHarry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting through the\\nsemi-darkness to the foot of his bed, where a small heap of parcels had\\nappeared. Ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents.\\n\\n\\'Another sweater from Mum... maroon again... see if you\\'ve got one.\\n\\nHarry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the\\nGryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince\\npies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all\\nthese things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair of\\nmaroon socks in his hand.\\n\\n\"Dunno...\"\\n\\nHarry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent, gleaming\\nbroomstick rolled out onto his bedspread. Ron dropped his socks and\\njumped off his bed for a closer look.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe it,\" he said hoarsely.\\n\\nIt was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone to see\\nevery day in Diagon Alley. Its handle glittered as he picked it up. He\\ncould feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsupported, at\\nexactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes moved from the\\ngolden registration number at the top of the handle, right down to the\\nperfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail.\\n\\n\"Who sent it to you?\" said Ron in a hushed voice.\\n\\n\"Look and see if there\\'s a card,\" said Harry.\\n\\nRon ripped apart the Firebolt\\'s wrappings.\\n\\n\"Nothing! Blimey, who\\'d spend that much on you?\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" said Harry, feeling stunned, \"I\\'m betting it wasn\\'t the\\nDursleys.\"\\n\\nI bet it was Dumbledore,\" said Ron, now walking around and around the\\nFirebolt, taking in every glorious inch. \"He sent you the Invisibility\\nCloak anonymously....\"\\n\\n\"That was my dad\\'s, though,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore was just Passing it\\non to me. He wouldn\\'t spend hundreds of Galleons on me. He can\\'t go\\ngiving students stuff like this --\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s why he wouldn\\'t say it was from him!\" said Ron. \"In case some\\ngit like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry\" -- Ron gave a great\\nwhoop of laughter -- \"Malfoy! Wait till he sees you on this! He\\'ll be\\nsick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t believe this,\" Harry muttered, running a hand along the\\nFirebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry\\'s bed, laughing his head off at the\\nthought of Malfoy. \"Who -?\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Ron, controlling himself, \"I know who it could\\'ve been --\\nLupin!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry, now starting to laugh himself \"Lupin? Listen, if he\\nhad this much gold, he\\'d be able to buy himself some new robes.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, but he likes you,\" said Ron. \"And he was away when your Nimbus\\ngot smashed, and he might\\'ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon\\nAlley and get this for you --\"\\n\\n\"What d\\'you mean, he was away?\" said Harry. \"He was ill when I was\\nplaying in that match.\"\\n\\n\"Well, he wasn\\'t in the hospital wing,\" said Ron. \"I was there, cleaning\\nout the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?\"\\n\\nHarry frowned at Ron.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see Lupin affording something like this.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'re you two laughing about?\"\\n\\nHermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and carrying\\nCrookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of tinsel tied\\naround his neck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t bring him in here!\" said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers from\\nthe depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket.\\n\\nBut Hermione wasn\\'t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto Seamus\\'s\\nempty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt.\\n\\n\"Oh, Harry! Who sent you that?\"\\n\\n\"No idea,\" said Harry. \"There wasn\\'t a card or anything with it.\"\\n\\nTo his great surprise, Hermione did not appear either excited or\\nintrigued by the news. On the contrary, her face fell, and she bit her\\nlip.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Hermione slowly, \"but it\\'s a bit odd, isn\\'t it? I\\nmean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\\nRon sighed exasperatedly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the best broom there is, Hermione,\" he said.\\n\\n\"So it must\\'ve been really expensive....\"\\n\\n\"Probably cost more than all the Slytherins\\' brooms put together,\" said\\nRon happily.\\n\\n\"Well... who\\'d send Harry something as expensive as that, and not even\\ntell him they\\'d sent it?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Who cares?\" said Ron impatiently. \"Listen, Harry, can I have a go on\\nit? Can I?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!\" said Hermione\\nshrilly.\\n\\nHarry and Ron looked at her.\\n\\n\"What d\\'you think Harry\\'s going to do with it -- sweep the floor?\" said\\nRon.\\n\\nBut before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from Seamus\\'s bed,\\nright at Ron\\'s chest.\\n\\n\"GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE!\" Ron bellowed as Crookshanks\\'s claws\\nripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a wild escape over his\\nshoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at\\nCrookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of Harry\\'s bed, knocking it\\nover and causing Ron to hop up and down, howling with pain.\\n\\nCrookshanks\\'s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tint,, whistling was\\nfilling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had become dislodged from Uncle\\nVernon\\'s old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor.\\n\\nI forgot about that!\" Harry said, bending down and picking up the\\nSneakoscope. I never wear those socks if I can help it....\\n\\nThe Sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm. Crookshanks was\\nhissing and spitting at it.\\n\\n\"You\\'d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,\" said Ron furiously,\\nsitting on Harry\\'s bed nursing his toe. \"Can\\'t you shut that thing up?\"\\nhe added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks\\'s\\nyellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron.\\n\\nHarry stuffed the Sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back\\ninto his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron\\'s stifled moans of\\npain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron\\'s hands. It had been a while\\nsince Harry had seen him out of Ron\\'s pocket, and he was unpleasantly\\nsurprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, was now very skinny;\\npatches of fur seemed to have fallen out too\\n\\n\"He\\'s not looking too good, is he?\" Harry said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s stress!\" said Ron. \"He\\'d be fine if that big stupid furball left\\nhim alone!\"\\n\\nBut Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical Menagerie had said\\nabout rats living only three years, couldn\\'t help feeling that unless\\nScabbers had powers he had never revealed, he was reaching the end of\\nhis life. And despite Ron\\'s frequent conplaints that Scabbers was both\\nboring and useless, he was sure Ron would be very miserable if Scabbers\\ndied.\\n\\nChristmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the Gryffindor\\ncommon room that morning. Hermione had shut Crookshanks in her\\ndormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying to kick him; Ron was\\nstill fuming about Crookshanks\\'s fresh attempt to eat Scabbers. Harry\\ngave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to\\nexamining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the common room\\nwith him. For some reason this seemed to annoy Hermione as well; she\\ndidn\\'t say anything, but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though\\nit too had been criticizing her cat.\\n\\nAt lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the House\\ntables had been moved against the walls again, and that a single table,\\nset for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors Dumbledore,\\nMcGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch,\\nthe caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a\\nvery old and rather moldy- looking tailcoat. There were only three other\\nstudents, two extremely nervous-looking first years and a sullen-faced\\nSlytherin fifth year.\\n\\n\"Merry Christmas!\" said Dumbledore as Harry, Ron, and Hermione\\napproached the table. \"As there are so few of us, it seemed foolish to\\nuse the House tables.... Sit down, sit down!\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table.\\n\\n\"Crackers!\" said Dumbledore enthusiastically, offering the end of a\\nlarge silver noisemaker to Snape, who took it reluctantly and tugged.\\nWith a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal a large,\\npointed witchs hat topped with a stuffed vulture.\\n\\nHarry, remembering the boggart, caught Ron\\'s eye and they both grinned;\\nSnape\\'s mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward Dumbledore, who\\nswapped it for his wizard\\'s hat at once.\\n\\n\"Dig in!\" he advised the table, beaming around.\\n\\nAs Harry was helping himself to roast potatoes, the doors of the Great\\nHall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding toward them as\\nthough on wheels. She had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the\\noccasion, making her look more than ever like a glittering, oversized\\ndragonfly.\\n\\n\"Sibyll, this is a pleasant surprise!\" said Dumbledore, standing up.\\n\\n\"I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,\" said Professor Trelawney in\\nher mistiest, most faraway voice, \"and to my astonishment, I saw myself\\nabandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. Who am I to\\nrefuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from my tower, and I\\ndo beg you to forgive my lateness....\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Let me\\ndraw you up a chair --\"\\n\\nAnd he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which revolved\\nfor a few seconds before falling with a thud between Professors Snape\\nand McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her\\nenormous eyes had been roving around the table, and she suddenly uttered\\na kind of soft scream.\\n\\nI dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen!\\nNothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen dine\\ntogether, the first to rise will be the first to die!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll risk it, Sibyll,\" said Professor McGonagall inpatiendy. \"Do sit\\ndown, the turkey\\'s getting stone cold.\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the empty\\nchair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though expecting a\\nthunderbolt to hit the table. Professor McGonagall poked a large spoon\\ninto the nearest tureen.\\n\\n\"Tripe, Sibyll?\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked around once\\nmore and said, \"But where is dear Professor Lupin?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,\" said Dumbledore, indicating\\nthat everybody should start serving themselves. \"Most unfortunate that\\nit should happen on Christmas Day.\"\\n\\n\"But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?\" said Professor McGonagall,\\nher eyebrows raised.\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney gave Professor McGonagall a very cold look.\\n\\n\"Certainly I knew, Minerva, 11 she said quietly. \"But one does not\\nparade the fact that one is All- Knowing. I frequently act as though I\\nam not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others nervous.\\n\\n\"That explains a great deal,\" said Professor McGonagall tartly.\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney\\'s voice suddenly became a good deal less misty.\\n\\n\"If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor Lupin will\\nnot be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is\\nshort. He positively fled when I offered to crystal gaze for him --\"\\n\\n\"Imagine that,\" said Professor McGonagall dryly.\\n\\nI doubt,\" said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised voice,\\nwhich put an end to Professor McGonagall and Professor Trelawney\\'s\\nconversation, \"that Professor Lupin is in any immediate danger. Severus,\\nyou\\'ve made the potion for him again?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Headmaster,\" said Snape. \"W -- what?\" said Harry, scrambling to\\nhis feet. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\"It will need to be checked for jinxes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Of\\ncourse, I\\'m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick\\nwill strip it down --\"\\n\\n\"Strip it down?\" repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall was mad.\\n\\n\"It shouldn\\'t take more than a few weeks,\" said Professor McGonagall.\\n\"You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing wrong with it!\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly.\\n\"Honestly, Professor --\"\\n\\n\"You can\\'t know that, Potter,\" said Professor McGonagall, quite kindly,\\n\"not until you\\'ve flown it, at any rate, and I\\'m afraid that is out of\\nthe question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I\\nshall keep you informed.\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Firebolt out of\\nthe portrait hole, which closed behind her. Harry stood staring after\\nher, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron,\\nhowever, rounded on Hermione.\\n\\n\"What did you go running to McGonagall for?\\n\\nHermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, but stood\\nup and faced Ron defiantly.\\n\\n\"Because I thought -- and Professor McGonagall agrees with me -- that\\nthat broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black!\"\\n\\nCHAPTER TWELVE\\n\\nTHE PATRONUS\\n\\nHarry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn\\'t stop him from\\nbeing angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the\\nworld for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he\\ndidn\\'t know whether he would ever see it again. He was positive that\\nthere was nothing wrong with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state\\nwould it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx\\ntests?\\n\\nRon was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the\\nstripping-down of a brand- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal\\ndamage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the\\nbest, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had\\ntaken refuge in the library and didn\\'t try to persuade her to come back.\\nAll in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly\\nafter New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again.\\nWood sought Harry out on the night before term started.\\n\\n\"Had a good Christmas?\" he said, and then, without waiting for an\\nanswer, he sat down, lowered his voice, and said, \"I\\'ve been, doing some\\nthinking over Christmas, Harry. After last match, you know. If the\\ndementors come to the next one... I mean... we can\\'t afford you to --\\nwell --\"\\n\\nWood broke off, looking awkward.\\n\\n\"I\\'m working on it,\" said Harry quickly. \"Professor Lupin said he\\'d\\ntrain me to ward off the dementors. We should be starting this week. He\\nsaid he\\'d have time after Christmas.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" said Wood, his expression clearing. \"Well, in that case -- I\\nreally didn\\'t want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a\\nnew broom yet?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"What! You\\'d better get a move on, you know -- you can\\'t ride that\\nShooting Star against Ravenclaw!\"\\n\\n\"He got a Firebolt for Christmas,\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"A Firebolt? No! Seriously? A -- a real Firebolt?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t get excited, Oliver,\" said Harry gloomily. \"I haven\\'t got it\\nanymore. It was confiscated.\" And he explained all about how the\\nFirebolt was now being checked for jinxes.\\n\\n\"Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?\"\\n\\n\"Sirius Black\" Harry said wearily. \"He\\'s supposed to be after me. So\\nMcGonagall reckons he might have sent it.\"\\n\\nWaving aside the information that a famous murderer was after his\\nSeeker, Wood said, \"But Black couldn\\'t have bought a Firebolt! He\\'s on\\nthe run! The whole country\\'s on the lookout for him! How could he just\\nwalk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick?\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" said Harry, \"but McGonagall still wants to strip it down --\"\\n\\nWood went pale.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go and talk to her, Harry,\" he promised. \"I\\'ll make her see\\nreason.... A Firebolt... a real Firebolt, on our team... She wants\\nGryffindor to win as much as we do.... I\\'ll make her see sense. A\\nFirebolt...\"\\n\\nClasses started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like\\ndoing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning,\\nbut Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their\\nenjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood\\nand leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards\\nscampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first\\nDivination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney\\nwas now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry\\nthat he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.\\n\\nIt was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get to;\\nafter his conversation with Wood, he wanted to get started on his\\nanti-dementor lessons as soon as possible.\\n\\n\"Ah yes,\" said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise at the end\\nof class. \"Let me see... how about eight o\\'clock on Thursday evening?\\nThe History of Magic classroom should be large enough.... I\\'ll have to\\nthink carefully about how we\\'re going to do this.... We can\\'t bring a\\nreal dementor into the castle to practice on....\"\\n\\n\"Still looks ill, doesn\\'t he?\" said Ron as they walked down the\\ncorridor, heading to dinner. \"What d\\'you reckon\\'s the matter with him?\"\\n\\nThere was a loud and impatient \"tuh\" from behind them. It was Hermione,\\nwho had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, repacking her bag,\\nwhich was so full of books it wouldn\\'t close.\\n\\n\"And what are you tutting at us for?\" said Ron irritably.\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" said Hermione in a lofty voice, heaving her bag back over her\\nshoulder.\\n\\n\"Yes, you were,\" said Ron. \"I said I wonder what\\'s wrong with Lupin, and\\nyou --\"\\n\\n\"Well, isn\\'t it obvious?\" said Hermione, with a look of maddening\\nsuperiority.\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t want to tell us, don\\'t,\" snapped Ron.\\n\\n\"Fine,\" said Hermione haughtily, and she marched off.\\n\\n\"She doesn\\'t know,\" said Ron, staring resentfully after Hermione. \"She\\'s\\njust trying to get us to talk to her again.\"\\n\\nAt eight o\\'clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for\\nthe History of Magic classroom. It was dark and empty when he arrived,\\nbut he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five minutes when\\nProfessor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing case, which he\\nheaved onto Professor Binn\\'s desk.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Another boggart,\" said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. \"I\\'ve been\\ncombing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this\\none lurking inside Mr. Filch\\'s filing cabinet. It\\'s the nearest we\\'ll\\nget to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he\\nsees you, so we\\'ll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my\\noffice when we\\'re not using him; there\\'s a cupboard under my desk he\\'ll\\nlike.\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn\\'t apprehensive at\\nall and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good substitute for a\\nreal dementor.\\n\\n\"So...\" Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and indicated that\\nHarry should do the same. \"The spell I am going to try and teach you is\\nhighly advanced magic, Harry -- well beyond ordinary Wizarding Level. It\\nis called the Patronus Charm.\"\\n\\n\"How does it work?\" said Harry nervously.\\n\\n\"Well, when it works correctly, It conjures up a Patronus,\" said Lupin,\\n\"which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield\\nbetween you and the dementor.\"\\n\\nHarry had a sudden vision of himself crouching behind a Hagridsized\\nfigure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \"The Patronus is\\na kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the\\ndementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it\\ncannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can\\'t hurt it.\\nBut I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for\\nyou. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it.\"\\n\\n\"What does a Patronus look like?\" said Harry curiously.\\n\\n\"Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\"\\n\\n\"And how do you conjure it?\"\\n\\n\"With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating,\\nwith all your might, on a single, very happy memory.\"\\n\\nHarry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing that\\nhad happened to him at the Dursleys\\' was going to do. Finally, he\\nsettled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick.\\n\\n\"Right,\" he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the wonderful,\\nsoaring sensation of his stomach.\\n\\n\"The incantation is this --\" Lupin cleared his throat. \"Expecto\\npatronum!\"\\n\\n\"Expecto patronum, \" Harry repeated under his breath, \"expecto\\npatronum.\"\\n\\n\"Concentrating hard on your happy memory?\"\\n\\n\"Oh -- yeah --\" said Harry, quickly forcing his thoughts back to that\\nfirst broom ride. \"Expecto patrono -- no, patronum -- sorry -- expecto\\npatronum, expecto patronum\"\\n\\nSomething whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it looked like a\\nwisp of silvery gas.\\n\\n\"Did you see that?\" said Harry excitedly. \"Something happened!\"\\n\\n\"Very good,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Right, then -- ready to try it on a\\ndementor?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving into the\\nmiddle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying,\\nbut something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his\\nmother again... but he shouldn\\'t think that, or he would hear her again,\\nand he didn\\'t want to... or did he?\\n\\nLupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled.\\n\\nA dementor rose slowly from the box, its hooded face turned toward\\nHarry, one glistening, scabbed hand gripping its cloak. The lamps around\\nthe classroom flickered and went out. The dementor stepped from the box\\nand started to sweep silently toward Harry, drawing a deep, rattling\\nbreath. A wave of piercing cold broke over him --\\n\\n\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto --\"\\n\\nBut the classroom and the dementor were dissolving.... Harry was failing\\nagain through thick white fog, and his mother\\'s voice was louder than\\never, echoing inside his head -- \"Not Harry! Not Harry! please -- I\\'ll\\ndo anything!\"\\n\\n\"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!\"\\n\\n\"Harry!\"\\n\\nHarry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the floor.\\nThe classroom lamps were alight again. He didn\\'t have to ask what had\\nhappened.\\n\\n\"Sorry,\" he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling down\\nbehind his glasses.\\n\\n\"Are you all right?\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"Yes...\" Harry pulled himself up on one of the desks and leaned against\\nit.\\n\\n\"Here --\" Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. \"Eat this before we try\\nagain. I didn\\'t expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I would\\nhave been astounded if you had.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s getting worse,\" Harry muttered, biting off the Frog\\'s head. \"I\\ncould hear her louder that time -- and him -- Voldemort\\n\\nLupin looked paler than usual. ,\\n\\n\"Harry, if you don\\'t want to continue, I will more than understand --\"\\n\\n\"I do!\" said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog\\ninto his mouth. \"I\\'ve got to! What if the dementors turn up at our match\\nagainst Ravenclaw? I can\\'t afford to fall off again. If we lose this\\ngame we\\'ve lost the Quidditch Cup!\"\\n\\n\"All right then... \" said Lupin. \"You might want to select \\'other\\nmemory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate on.... That one doesn\\'t\\nseem to have been strong enough....\"\\n\\nHarry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor had won the\\nHouse Championship last year had definitely qualified as very happy. He\\ngripped his wand tightly again and took up his position in the middle of\\nthe classroom.\\n\\n\"Ready?\" said Lupin, gripping the box lid.\\n\\n\"Ready,\" said Harry; trying hard to fill his head with happy thoughts\\nabout Gryffindor winning, and not dark thoughts about what was going to\\nhappen when the box opened.\\n\\n\"Go!\" said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold and dark\\nonce more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its breath; one rotting\\nhand was extending toward Harry -\\n\\n\"Expecto patronum!\" Harry yelled. \"Expecto patronum! Expecto Pat --\"\\n\\nWhite fog obscured his senses... big, blurred shapes were moving around\\nhim... then came a new voice, a man\\'s voice, shouting, panicking --\\n\\n\"Lily, take Harry and go! It\\'s him! Go! Run! I\\'ll hold him off --\"\\n\\nThe sounds of someone stumbling ftom a room -- a door bursting open -- a\\ncackle of high- pitched laughter --\\n\\n\"Harry! Harry... wake up....\"\\n\\nLupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a minute\\nbefore Harry understood why he was lying on a dusty classroom floor.\\n\\n\"I heard my dad,\" Harry mumbled. \"That\\'s the first time I\\'ve ever heard\\nhim -- he tried to take on Voldemort himself, to give my mum time to run\\nfor it....\"\\n\\nHarry suddenly realized that there were tears on his face mingling with\\nthe sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping them off on his\\nrobes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that Lupin wouldn\\'t see.\\n\\n\"You heard James?\" said Lupin in a strange voice.\\n\\n\"Yeah...\" Face dry, Harry looked up. \"Why -- you didn\\'t know my dad, did\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"I -- I did, as a matter of fact,\" said Lupin. \"We were friends at\\nHogwarts. Listen, Harry -- perhaps we should leave it here for tonight.\\nThis charm is ridiculously advanced.... I shouln\\'t have suggested\\nputting you through this....\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Harry. He got up again. \"I\\'ll have one more go! I\\'m not\\nthinking of happy enough things, that\\'s what it is.... Hang on....\"\\n\\nHe racked his brains. A really, really happy memory... one that he could\\nturn into a good, strong Patronus...\\n\\nThe moment when he\\'d first found out he was a wizard, and would be\\nleaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn\\'t a happy memory, he\\ndidn\\'t know what was.... Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when\\nhe\\'d realized he\\'d be leaving Privet Drive, Harry got to his feet and\\nfaced the packing case once more.\\n\\n\"Ready?\" said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this against his\\nbetter judgment. \"Concentrating hard? All right -- go!\"\\n\\nHe pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the dementor\\nrose out of it; the room fell cold and dark\\n\\n\\'EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" Harry bellowed. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM! EXPECTO PATRONUM!\\n\"\\n\\nThe screaming inside Harry\\'s head had started again -- except this time,\\nit sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned radio -- softer\\nand louder and softer again -- and he could still see the dementor -- it\\nhad halted -- and then a huge, silver shadow came bursting out of the\\nend of Harry\\'s wand, to hover between him and the dementor, and though\\nHarry\\'s legs felt like water, he was still on his feet -- though for how\\nmuch longer, he wasn\\'t sure --\\n\\n\"Riddikulus!\" roared Lupin, springing forward.\\n\\nThere was a loud crack, and Harry\\'s cloudy Patronus vanished along with\\nthe dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted as if he\\'d just\\nrun a mile, and felt his legs shaking. Out of the corner of his eye, he\\nsaw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into the packing case with\\nhis wand; it had turned into a silvery orb again.\\n\\n\"Excellent!\" Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. \"Excellent,\\nHarry! That was definitely a start!\"\\n\\n\"Can we have another go? Just one more go?\"\\n\\n\"Not now,\" said Lupin firmly. \"You\\'ve had enough for one night. Here --\"\\n\\nHe handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes\\' best chocolate.\\n\\n\"Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfrey will be after my blood. Same time next\\nweek?\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry. He took a bite of the chocolate and watched Lupin\\nextinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disappearance of the\\ndementor. A thought had just occurred to him.\\n\\n\"Professor Lupin?\" he said. \"If you knew my dad, you must\\'ve known\\nSirius Black as well.\"\\n\\nLupin turned very quickly.\\n\\n\"What gives you that idea?\" he said sharply.\\n\\n\"Nothing -- I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts too....\"\\n\\nLupin\\'s face relaxed.\\n\\n\"Yes, I knew him,\" he said shortly. \"Or I thought I did. You\\'d better be\\noff, Harry, it\\'s getting late.\"\\n\\nHarry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around a\\ncorner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down on its\\nplinth to finish his chocolate, wishing he hadn\\'t mentioned Black, as\\nLupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry\\'s thoughts\\nwandered back to his mother and father...\\n\\nHe felt drained and strangely empty, even though he was so full of\\nchocolate. Terrible though it was to hear his parents\\' last moments\\nreplayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry had heard\\ntheir voices since he was a very small child. But he\\'d never be able to\\nproduce a proper Patronus if he half wanted to hear his parents\\nagain....\\n\\n\"They\\'re dead,\" he told himself sternly. \"They\\'re dead and listening to\\nechoes of them won\\'t bring them back. You\\'d better get a grip on\\nyourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.\"\\n\\nHe stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, and\\nheaded back to Gryffindor Tower.\\n\\nRavenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin\\nwon, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for\\nGryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw too. He\\ntherefore increased the number of team practices to five a leek. This\\nmeant that with Lupin\\'s anti-dementor classes, which in themselves were\\nmore draining than six Quidditch practices, Harry had just one night a\\nweek to do all his homework. Even so, he was showing the strain nearly\\nas much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting\\nto her. Every night, without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner\\nof the common room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts,\\nrune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file\\nupon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped\\nwhen she was interrupted.\\n\\n\"How\\'s she doing it?\" Ron muttered to Harry one evening as Harry sat\\nfinishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked\\nup. Hermione was barely visible behind a tottering pile of books.\\n\\n\"Doing what?\"\\n\\n\"Getting to all her classes!\" Ron said. \"I heard her talking to\\nProfessor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going\\non about yesterday\\'s lesson, but Hermione can\\'t \\'ve been there, because\\nshe was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie McMillan told me\\nshe\\'s never missed a Muggle Studies class, but half of them are at the\\nsame time as Divination, and she\\'s never missed one of them either!\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione\\'s impossible\\nschedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with Snape\\'s essay.\\nTwo seconds later, however, he was interrupted again, this time by Wood.\\n\\n\"Bad news, Harry. I\\'ve just been to see Professor McGonagall about the\\nFirebolt. She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me. Told m\\' I\\'d got my\\npriorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup\\nthan I do about you staying alive. Just because I told her I didn\\'t care\\nif it threw you off, as long as you caught the Snitch first.\" Wood shook\\nhis head in disbelief. \"Honestly, the way she was yelling at me... you\\'d\\nthink I\\'d said something terrible... then I asked her how much longer\\nshe was going to keep it. He screwed up his face and imitated Professor\\nMcGonagall\\'s severe voice. \\'As long as necessary, Wood\\'... I reckon it\\'s\\ntime you ordered a new broom, Harry. There\\'s an order form at the back\\nof Which Broomstick... you could get a Nimbus Two Thousand and One, like\\nMalfoy\\'s got.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,\" said Harry flatly.\\n\\nJanuary faded imperceptibly into February, with no change in the\\nbitterly cold weather. The match against Ravenclaw was drawing nearer\\nand nearer, but Harry still hadn\\'t ordered a new broom. He was now\\nasking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt after every\\nTransfiguration lesson, Ron standing hopefully at his shoulder, Hermione\\nrushing past with her face averted.\\n\\n\"No, Potter, you can\\'t have it back yet,\" Professor McGonagall told him\\nthe twelfth time this happened, before he\\'d even opened his mouth.\\n\"We\\'ve checked for most of the usual curses, but Professor Flitwick\\nbelieves the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex. I shall tell you\\nonce we\\'ve finished checking it. Now, please stop badgering me.\"\\n\\nTo make matters even worse, Harry\\'s anti-dementor lessons were not going\\nnearly as well as he had hoped. Several sessions on, he was able to\\nproduce an indistinct, silvery shadow every time the boggart-dementor\\napproached him, but his Patronus was too feeble to drive the dementor\\naway. All it did was hover, like a semitransparent cloud, draining Harry\\nof energy as he fought to keep it there. Harry felt angry with himself,\\nguilty about his secret desire to hear his parents\\' voices again.\\n\\n\"You\\'re expecting too much of yourself,\" said Professor Lupin, sternly\\nin their fourth week of practice. \"For a thirteen-year-old wizard, even\\nan indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You aren\\'t passing out\\nanymore, are you?\"\\n\\nI thought a Patronus would -- charge the dementors down or something,\"\\nsaid Harry dispiritedly. \"Make them disappear --\"\\n\\n\"The true Patronus does do that,\" said Lupin. \"But you\\'ve achieved a\\ngreat deal in a very short space of time. If the dementors put in an\\nappearance at your next Quidditch match, You will be able to keep them\\nat bay long enough to get back to the ground.\"\\n\\n\"You said it\\'s harder if there are loads of them,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"I have complete confidence in you,\" said Lupin, smiling. \"Here --\\nyou\\'ve earned a drink - something from the Three Broomsticks. You won\\'t\\nhave tried it before --\"\\n\\nHe pulled two bottles out of his briefcase.\\n\\n\"Butterbeer!\" said Harry, without thinking. \"Yeah, I like that stuff!\"\\n\\nLupin raised an eyebrow.\\n\\n\"Oh -Ron and Hermione brought me some back from Hogsmeade,\" Harry lied\\nquickly.\\n\\nI see,\" said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. \"Well --\\nlet\\'s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not that I\\'m\\nsupposed to take sides, as a teacher... \" he added hastily\\n\\nThey drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced something he\\'d\\nbeen wondering for a while.\\n\\n\"What\\'s under a dementor\\'s hood?\"\\n\\nProfessor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"Hmmm... well, the only people who really know are in no condition to\\ntell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to use its last and\\nworst weapon.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"They call it the Dementor\\'s Kiss,\" said Lupin, with a slightly twisted\\nsmile. \"It\\'s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly. I\\nsuppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp\\ntheir jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul.\"\\n\\nHarry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer.\\n\\n\"What -- they kill --?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no,\" said Lupin. \"Much worse than that. You can exist without your\\nsoul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But\\nyou\\'ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no. .. anything.\\nThere\\'s no chance at all of recovery. You\\'ll just exist. As an empty\\nshell. And your soul is gone forever... lost.\"\\n\\nLupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \"It\\'s the fate that\\nawaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The\\nMinistry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find\\nhim.\"\\n\\nHarry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having their soul\\nsucked out through their mouth. But then he thought of Black.\\n\\n\"He deserves it,\" he said suddenly.\\n\\n\"You think so?\" said Lupin lightly. \"Do you really think anyone deserves\\nthat?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry defiantly. \"For... for some things...\"\\n\\nHe would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation he\\'d\\noverheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black betraying\\nhis mother and father, but it would have involved revealing that he\\'d\\ngone to Hogsmeade without permission, and he knew Lupin wouldn\\'t be very\\nimpressed by that. So he finished his butterbeer, thanked Lupin, and\\nleft the History of Magic classroom.\\n\\nHarry half wished that he hadn\\'t asked what was under a dementor\\'s hood,\\nthe answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost in unpleasant\\nthoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul sucked out of you\\nthat he walked headlong into Professor McGonagall halfway up the stairs.\\n\\n\"Do watch where you\\'re going, Potter!\"\\n\\n\"Sorry, Professor --\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room, Well,\\nhere it is, we\\'ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn\\'t\\nseem to be anything wrong with it at all. You\\'ve got a very good friend\\nsomewhere, Potter....\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it looked as\\nmagnificent as ever.\\n\\n\"I can have it back?\" Harry said weakly. \"Seriously?\"\\n\\n\"Seriously,\" said Professor McGonagall, and she was actually smiling. \"I\\ndaresay you\\'ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday\\'s match, won\\'t\\nyou? And Potter -- do try and win, won\\'t you? Or we\\'ll be out of the\\nrunning for the eighth year. in a row, as Professor Snape was kind\\nenough to remind me only last night....\"\\n\\nSpeechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upstairs toward Gryffindor\\nTower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing toward him, grinning\\nfrom ear to ear.\\n\\n\"She gave it to You? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it?\\nTomorrow?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah... anything,\" said Harry, his heart lighter than it had been in a\\nmonth. \"You know what -- we should make up with Hermione.... She was\\nonly trying to help....\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, all right,\" said Ron. \"She\\'s in the common room how working, for\\na change --\"\\n\\nThey turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw Neville\\nLongbottom, pleading with Sir Cadogan, who seemed to be refusing him\\nentrance.\\n\\n\"I wrote them down!\" Neville was saying tearfully. \"But I must\\'ve\\ndropped them somewhere!\"\\n\\n\"A likely tale!\" roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and Ron: \"Good\\neven, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in irons. He is trying\\nto force entry to the chambers within!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, shut up,\" said Ron as he and Harry drew level with Neville.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve lost the passwords!\" Neville told them miserably. \"I made him tell\\nme what passwords he was going to use this week, because he keeps\\nchanging them, and now I don\\'t know what I\\'ve done with them!\"\\n\\n\"Oddsbodikins,\" said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked extremely\\ndisappointed and reluctantly swung forward to let them into the common\\nroom. There was a sudden, excited murmur as every head turned and the\\nnext moment, Harry was surrounded by people exclaiming over his\\nFirebolt.\\n\\n\"Where\\'d you get it, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Will you let me have a go?\" \"Have you ridden it yet, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Ravenclaw\\'ll have no chance, they\\'re all on Cleansweep Sevens!\"\\n\\n\"Can I just hold it, Harry?\"\\n\\nAfter ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was Passed around and\\nadmired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and Harry and Ron had a\\nclear view of Hermione, the only person who hadn\\'t rushed over to them,\\nbent over her work and carefully avoiding their eyes. Harry and Ron\\napproached her table and at last, she looked up.\\n\\n\"I got it back,\" said Harry, grinning at her and holding up the\\nFirebolt.\\n\\n\"See, Hermione? There wasn\\'t anything wrong with it!\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Well -- there might have been!\" said Hermione. \"I mean, at least you\\nknow now that it\\'s safe!\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"Id better put it upstairs.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll take it!\" said Ron eagerly. \"I\\'ve got to give Scabbers his rat\\ntonic.\"\\n\\nHe took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass,\\ncarried it away up the boys\\' staircase.\\n\\n\"Can I sit down, then?\" Harry asked Hermione.\\n\\n\"I suppose so,\" said Hermione, moving a great stack of parchment off a\\nchair.\\n\\nHarry looked around at the cluttered table, at the long Arithmancy essay\\non which the ink was still glistening, at the even longer Muggle Studies\\nessay (\"Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity\" and at the rune\\ntranslation Hermione was now poring over.\\n\\n\"How are you getting through all this stuff?\" Harry asked her.\\n\\n\"Oh, well -- you know -- working hard,\" said Hermione. Close-up, Harry\\nsaw that she looked almost as tired as Lupin.\\n\\n\"Why don\\'t you just drop a couple of subjects?\" Harry asked, watching\\nher lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t do that!\" said Hermione, looking scandalized.\\n\\n\"Arithmancy looks terrible,\" said Harry, picking up a very\\ncomplicated-looking number chart.\\n\\n\"Oh no, it\\'s wonderful!\" said Hermione earnestly. \"It\\'s my favorite\\nsubject! It\\'s --\"\\n\\nBut exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never found out.\\nAt that precise moment, a strangled yell echoed down the boys\\'\\nstaircase. The whole common room fell silent, staring, petrified, at the\\nentrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing louder and louder -- and\\nthen Ron came leaping into view, dragging with him a bedsheet.\\n\\n\"LOOK!\" he bellowed, striding over to Hermione\\'s table.\\n\\n\"LOOK!\" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.\\n\\n\"Ron, what --?\"\\n\\n\"SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!\"\\n\\nHermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewildered. Harry\\nlooked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was something red on it.\\nSomething that looked horribly like --\\n\\n\"BLOOD!\" Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \"HE\\'S GONE! AND YOU KNOW\\nWHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\"\\n\\n\"N -- no,\" said Hermione in a trembling voice.\\n\\nRon threw something down onto Hermione\\'s rune translation. Hermione and\\nHarry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were\\nseveral long, ginger cat hairs.\\n\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\n\\nGRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW\\n\\nIt looked like the end of Ron and Hermione\\'s friendship. Each was so\\nangry with the other that Harry couldn\\'t see how they\\'d ever make up.\\n\\nRon was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks\\'s attempts to\\neat Scabbers seriously, hadn\\'t bothered to keep a close enough watch on\\nhim, and was still trying to pretend that Crookshanks was innocent by\\nsuggesting that Ron look for Scabbers under all the boys\\' beds.\\nHermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely that Ron had no proof that\\nCrookshanks had eaten Scabbers, that the ginger hairs might have been\\nthere since Christmas, and that Ron had been prejudiced against her cat\\never since Crookshanks had landed on Ron\\'s head in the Magical\\nMenagerie.\\n\\nPersonally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers, and when\\nhe tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence all pointed that\\nway, she lost her temper with Harry too.\\n\\n\"Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!\" she said shrilly. \"First the\\nFirebolt, now Scabbers, everything\\'s my fault, isn\\'t it! just leave me\\nalone, Harry, I\\'ve got a lot of work to do!\"\\n\\nRon had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed.\\n\\n\"Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers was,\" said\\nFred bracingly. \"And he\\'s been off-color for ages, he was wasting away.\\nIt was probably better for him to snuff it quickly -- one swallow -- he\\nprobably didn\\'t feel a thing.\"\\n\\n\"Fred!\" said Ginny indignantly.\\n\\n\"All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,\" said George.\\n\\n\"He bit Goyle for us once!\" Ron said miserably. \"Remember, Harry?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s true,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"His finest hour,\" said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. \"Let the\\nscar on Goyle\\'s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. Oh,\\ncome on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat, what\\'s\\nthe point of moaning?\"\\n\\nIn a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to come\\nalong to the Gryffindor team\\'s final practice before the Ravenclaw\\nmatch, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after they\\'d\\nfinished. This did seem to take Ron\\'s mind off Scabbers for a moment\\n(\"Great! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it?\") so they set off for\\nthe Quidditch field together.\\n\\nMadam Hooch, who was still overseeing Gryffindor practices to keep an\\neye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as everyone else\\nhad been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the\\nbenefit of her professional opinion.\\n\\n\"Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it\\'s a\\nslight list to the tail end -- you often find they develop a drag after\\na few years. They\\'ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the\\nCleansweeps, reminds me of the old Silver Arrows -- a Pity they\\'ve\\nstopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old broom\\nit was too....\"\\n\\nShe continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, \"Er -- Madam\\nHooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? We need to\\npractice....\"\\n\\n\"Oh -- right -- here you are, then, Potter,\" said Madam Hooch. \"I\\'ll sit\\nover here with Weasley....\"\\n\\nShe and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the Gryffindor\\nteam gathered around Wood for his final instructions for tomorrow\\'s\\nmatch.\\n\\n\"Harry, I\\'ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. It\\'s Cho\\nChang. She\\'s a fourth year, and she\\'s pretty good.... I really hoped she\\nwouldn\\'t be fit, she\\'s had some problems with injuries....\" Wood scowled\\nhis displeasure that Cho Chang had made a full recovery, then said, \"On\\nthe other hand, she rides a Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like\\na joke next to the Firebolt.\" He gave Harry\\'s broom a look of fervent\\nadmiration, then said, \"Okay, everyone, let\\'s go -- \"\\n\\nAnd at long last, Harry mounted his Firebolt, and kicked off from the\\nground.\\n\\nIt was better than he\\'d ever dreamed. The Firebolt turned with the\\nlightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his grip; it\\nsped across the field at such speed that the stadium turned into a\\ngreen-and-gray blur; Harry turned it so sharply that Alicia Spinnet\\nscreamed, then he went into a perfectly controlled dive, brushing the\\ngrassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, fifty feet into\\nthe air again.\\n\\n\"Harry, I\\'m letting the Snitch out!\" Wood called.\\n\\nHarry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he outstripped\\nit easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten\\nseconds had caught it tightly in his hand.\\n\\nThe team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a\\nminute\\'s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the\\nothers; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell\\'s knee, looped her easily,\\nand caught it again.\\n\\nIt was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the\\nFirebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by\\nthe time they hit the ground again, Wood didn\\'t have a single criticism\\nto make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t see what\\'s going to stop us tomorrow!\" said Wood. \"Not unless\\n-- Harry, you\\'ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing it were\\nstronger.\\n\\n\"The dementors won\\'t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore\\'d go ballistic,\"\\nsaid Fred confidently.\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s hope not,\" said Wood. \"Anyway -- good work, everyone. Let\\'s\\nget back to the tower... turn in early --\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,\" Harry told\\nWood, and while the rest of the team headed off to the locker rooms,\\nHarry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to the stands and came\\nto meet him. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep in her seat.\\n\\n\"Here you go,\" said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt.\\n\\nRon, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom and zoomed\\noff into the gathering darkness while Harry walked around the edge of\\nthe field, watching him. Night had fallen before Madam Hooch awoke with\\na start, told Harry and Ron off for not waking her, and insisted that\\nthey go back to the castle.\\n\\nHarry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the shadowy\\nstadium, discussing the Firebolt\\'s superbly smooth action, its\\nphenomenal acceleration, and its pinpoint turning. They were halfway\\ntoward the castle when Harry, glancing to his left, saw something that\\nmade his heart turn over -- a pair of eyes, gleaming out of the\\ndarkness.\\n\\nHarry stopped dead, his heart banging against his ribs.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" said Ron.\\n\\nHarry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, \"Lumos!\"\\n\\nA beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and\\nilluminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding leaves, was\\nCrookshanks.\\n\\n\"Get out of here!\" Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone\\nlying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks\\nhad vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail.\\n\\n\"See?\" Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. \"She\\'s still\\nletting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down\\nScabbers with a couple of birds now....\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped\\nthrough him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had belonged\\nto the Grim. They set off for the castle once more. slightly ashamed of\\nhis moment of panic, Harry didn\\'t say anything to Ron -- nor did he look\\nleft or right until they had reached the well-lit entrance hall.\\n\\nHarry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest of the boys\\nin his dormitory, all of whom seemed to think the Firebolt deserved a\\nsort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in\\nthe direction of the Firebolt, and there was a good deal of excited\\nmuttering. Harry saw, with enormous satisfaction, that the Slytherin\\nteam were all looking thunderstruck.\\n\\n\"Did you see his face?\" said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfay. \"He\\ncan\\'t believe it! This is brilliant!\"\\n\\nWood, too, was basking in the reflected glory of the Firebolt.\\n\\n\"Put it here, Harry,\" he said, laying the broom in the middle of the\\ntable and carefully turning it so that its name faced upward. People\\nfrom the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were soon coming over to look.\\nCedric Diggory came over to congratulate Harry on having acquired such a\\nsuperb replacement for his Nimbus, and Percy\\'s Ravenclaw girlfriend,\\nPenelope Clearwater, asked if she could actually hold the Firebolt.\\n\\n\"Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!\" said Percy heartily as she examined the\\nFirebolt closely. \"Penelope and I have got a bet on,\" he told the team.\\n\"Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!\"\\n\\nPenelope put the Firebolt down again, thanked Harry, and went back to\\nher table.\\n\\n\"Harry -- make sure you win,\" said Percy, in an urgent whisper. \"I\\nhaven\\'t got ten Galleons. Yes, I\\'m coming, Penny!\" And-he bustled off to\\njoin her in a piece of toast.\\n\\n\"Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?\" said a cold, drawling voice.\\n\\nDraco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Coyle right\\nbehind him.\\n\\n\"Yeah, reckon so,\" said Harry casually.\\n\\n\"Got plenty of special features, hasn\\'t it?\" said Malfoy, eyes\\nglittering maliciously. \"Shame it doesn\\'t come with a parachute -- in\\ncase you get too near a dementor.\"\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle sniggered.\\n\\n\"Pity you can\\'t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,\" said Harry. \"Then\\nit could catch the Snitch for you.\"\\n\\nThe Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy\\'s pale eyes narrowed, and he\\nstalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team,\\nwho put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry\\'s\\nbroom really was a Firebolt.\\n\\nAt a quarter to eleven, the Gryffindor team set off for the locker\\nrooms. The weather couldn\\'t have been more different from their match\\nagainst Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light breeze;\\nthere would be no visibility problems this time, and Harry, though\\nnervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quidditch match\\ncould bring. They could hear the rest of the school moving into the\\nstadium beyond. Harry took off his black school robes, removed his wand\\nfrom his pocket, and stuck it inside the T-shirt he was going to wear\\nunder his Quidditch robes. He only hoped he wouldn\\'t need it. He\\nwondered suddenly whether Professor Lupin was in the crowd, watching.\\n\\n\"You know what we\\'ve got to do,\" said Wood as they prepared to leave the\\nlocker rooms. \"If we lose this match, we\\'re out of the running. just --\\njust fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we\\'ll be okay!\"\\n\\nThey walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The Ravenclaw\\nteam, dressed in blue, were already standing in the middle of the field.\\nTheir Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was\\nshorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn\\'t help noticing,\\nnervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as\\nthe teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight\\nlurch in the region of his stomach that he didn\\'t think had anything to\\ndo with nerves.\\n\\n\"Wood, Davies, shake hands,\" Madam Hooch said briskly, and Wood shook\\nhands with the Ravenclaw Captain.\\n\\n\"Mount your brooms... on my whistle... three -- two -- one --\"\\n\\nHarry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher and faster\\nthan any other broom; he soared around the stadium and began squinting\\naround for the Snitch, listening all the while to the commentary, which\\nwas being provided by the Weasley twins\\' friend Lee Jordan.\\n\\n\"They\\'re off, and the big excitement this match is the Firebolt that\\nHarry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which Broomstick,\\nthe Firebolt\\'s going to be the broom of choice for the national teams at\\nthis year\\'s World Championship --\"\\n\\n\"Jordan, would you mind telling us what\\'s going on in the match?\"\\ninterrupted Professor McGonagall\\'s voice.\\n\\n\"Right you are, Professor -- just giving a bit of background information\\n-- the Firebolt, incidentally, has a built-in auto-brake and --\"\\n\\n\"Jordan!\"\\n\\n\"Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor, heading\\nfor goal...\"\\n\\nHarry streaked past Katie in the opposite direction, gazing around for a\\nglint of gold and noticing that Cho Chang was tailing him closely. She\\nwas undoubtedly a very good flier -- she kept cutting across him,\\nforcing him to change direction.\\n\\n\"Show her your acceleration, Harry!\" Fred yelled as he whooshed past in\\npursuit of a Bludger that was aiming for Alicia.\\n\\nHarry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Ravenclaw goal\\nposts and Cho fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in scoring the first\\ngoal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the field went wild, he saw\\nit -- the Snitch was close to the ground, flitting near one of the\\nbarriers.\\n\\nHarry dived; Cho saw what he was doing and tore after him -- Harry was\\nspeeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his speciality, he was\\nten feet away --\\n\\nThen a Bludger, hit by one of the Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelting out of\\nnowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, and in those\\nfew, crucial seconds, the Snitch had vanished.\\n\\nThere was a great \"Ooooooh\" of disappointment from the Gryffindor\\nsupporters, but much applause for their Beater from the Ravenclaw end.\\nGeorge Weasley vented his feelings by hitting the second Bludger\\ndirectly at the offending Beater, who was forced to roll right over in\\nmidair to avoid it.\\n\\n\"Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that Firebolt\\ngo! Potter\\'s really putting it through its paces now, see it turn --\\nChang\\'s Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt\\'s precision- balance\\nis really noticeable in these long --\"\\n\\n\"JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIREBOLTS? GET ON WITH THE\\nCOMMENTARY!\"\\n\\nRavenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, which put\\nGryffindor only fifty points ahead -- if Cho got the Snitch before him,\\nRavenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw\\nChaser, scanning the field frantically -- a glint of gold, a flutter of\\ntiny wings -- the Snitch was circling the Gryffindor goal post --\\n\\nHarry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead -- but just\\nthen, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him --\\n\\n\"HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!\" Wood roared as Harry swerved\\nto avoid a collision. \"KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!\"\\n\\nHarry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The Snitch had\\nvanished again. Harry turned his Firebolt upward and was soon twenty\\nfeet above the game. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cho following\\nhim.... She\\'d decided to mark him rather than search for the Snitch\\nherself... All right, then... if she wanted to tail him, she\\'d have to\\ntake the consequences....\\n\\nHe dived again, and Cho, thinking he\\'d seen the Snitch, tried to follow;\\nHarry pulled out of the dive very sharply; she hurtled downward; he rose\\nfast as a bullet once more, and then saw it, for the third time -- the\\nSnitch was glittering way above the field at the Ravenclaw end.\\n\\nHe accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, gaining on\\nthe Snitch with every second -- then --\\n\\n\"Oh!\" screamed Cho, pointing.\\n\\nDistracted, Harry looked down.\\n\\nThree dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were looking up at\\nhim.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t stop to think. Plunging a hand down the neck of his robes, he\\nwhipped out his wand and roared, \"Expecto patronum!\"\\n\\nSomething silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his\\nwand. He knew it had shot directly at the dementors but didn\\'t pause to\\nwatch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked ahead -- he was\\nnearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasping his wand and just\\nmanaged to close his fingers over the small, struggling Snitch.\\n\\nMadam Hooch\\'s whistle sounded. Harry turned around in midair and saw six\\nscarlet blurs bearing down on him; next moment, the whole team was\\nhugging him so hard he was nearly pulled off his broom. Down below he\\ncould hear the roars of the Gryffindors in the crowd.\\n\\n\"That\\'s my boy!\" Wood kept yelling. Alicia, Angelina, and Katie had all\\nkissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so tight Harry felt as though his\\nhead would come off In complete disarray, the team managed to make its\\nway back to the ground. Harry got off his broom and looked up to see a\\ngaggle of Gryffindor supporters sprinting onto the field, Ron in the\\nlead. Before he knew it, he had been engulfed by the cheering crowd.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" Ron yelled, yanking Harry\\'s arm into the air. \"Yes! Yes!\"\\n\\n\"Well done, Harry!\" said Percy, looking delighted. \"Ten Galleons to me!\\nMust find Penelope, excuse me --\"\\n\\n\"Good for you, Harry!\" roared Seamus Finnigan.\\n\\n\"Ruddy brilliant!\" boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling\\nGryffindors.\\n\\n\"That was quite some Patronus,\" said a voice in Harry\\'s ear.\\n\\nHarry turned around to see Professor Lupin, who looked both shaken and\\npleased.\\n\\n\"The dementors didn\\'t affect me at all!\" Harry said excitedly. \"I didn\\'t\\nfeel a thing!\"\\n\\n\"That would be because they -- er -- weren\\'t dementors,\" said Professor\\nLupin. \"Come and see -- \"\\n\\nHe led Harry out of the crowd until they were able to see the edge of\\nthe field.\\n\\n\"You gave Mr. Malfoy quite a fright,\" said Lupin.\\n\\nHarry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were Malfoy,\\nCrabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Captain, all\\nstruggling to remove themselves from long, black, hooded robes. It\\nlooked as though Malfoy had been standing on Goyle\\'s shoulders. Standing\\nover them, with an expression of the utmost fury on her face, was\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\n\\n\"An unworthy trick!\" she was shouting. \"A low and cowardly attempt to\\nsabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, and fifty\\npoints from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor Dumbledore about\\nthis, make no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!\"\\n\\nIf anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor\\'s victory, it was\\nthis. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry\\'s side, doubled up\\nwith laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extricate himself from\\nthe robe, Goyle\\'s head still stuck inside it.\\n\\n\"Come on, Harry!\" said George, fighting his way over. \"Party! Gryffindor\\ncommon room, now!\"\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he and the\\nrest of the team led the way, still in their scarlet robes, out of the\\nstadium and back up to the castle.\\n\\nIt felt as though they had already won the Quidditch Cup; the party went\\non all day and well into the night. Fred and George Weasley disappeared\\nfor a couple of hours and returned with armfuls of bottles of\\nbutterbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of Honeydukes sweets.\\n\\n\"How did you do that?\" squealed Angelina Johnson as George started\\nthrowing Peppermint Toads into the crowd.\\n\\n\"With a little help from Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,\" Fred\\nmuttered in Harry\\'s ear.\\n\\nOnly one person wasn\\'t joining in the festivities. Hermione, incredibly,\\nwas sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous book entitled\\nHome Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry broke away from\\nthe table where Fred and George had started juggling butterbeer bottles\\nand went over to her.\\n\\n\"Did you even come to the match?\" he asked her.\\n\\n\"Of course I did,\" said Hermione in a strangely high-pitched voice, not\\nlooking up. \"And I\\'m very glad we won, and I think you did really well,\\nbut I need to read this by Monday.\"\\n\\n\"Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,\" Harry said, looking over\\nat Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the\\nhatchet.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t, Harry. I\\'ve still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to\\nread!\" said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. \"Anyway...\" She\\nglanced over at Ron too. \"He doesn\\'t want me to join in.\"\\n\\nThere was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly,\\n\"If Scabbers hadn\\'t just been eaten, he could have had some of those\\nFudge Flies. He used to really like them --\"\\n\\nHermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she\\ntucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward\\nthe staircase to the girls\\' dormitories and out of sight.\\n\\n\"Can\\'t you give her a break?\" Harry asked Ron quietly.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ron flatly. \"If she just acted like she was sorry -- but\\nshe\\'ll never admit she\\'s wrong, Hermione. She\\'s still acting like\\nScabbers has gone on vacation or something.\"\\n\\nThe Gryffindor party ended only when Professor McGonagall turned up in\\nher tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the morning, to insist\\nthat they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed the stairs to their\\ndormitory, still discussing the match. At last, exhausted, Harry climbed\\ninto bed, twitched the hangings of his four-poster shut to block out a\\nray of moonlight, lay back, and felt himself almost instantly drifting\\noff to sleep....\\n\\nHe had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, his\\nFirebolt over his shoulder, following something silvery-white. It was\\nwinding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only catch\\nglimpses of it between the leaves. Anxious to catch up with it, he sped\\nup, but as he moved faster, so did his quarry. Harry broke into a run,\\nand ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out,\\nand ahead he could hear galloping. Then he turned a corner into a\\nclearing and -\\n\\n\"AAARRGGHH! NOOO!\"\\n\\nHarry woke as suddenly as though he\\'d been hit in the face. Disoriented\\nin the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings, he could hear\\nmovements around him, and Seamus Finnigan\\'s voice from the other side of\\nthe room: \"What\\'s going on?\"\\n\\nHarry thought he heard the dormitory door slam. At last finding the\\ndivide in his curtains, he ripped them back, and at the same moment,\\nDean Thomas lit his lamp.\\n\\nRon was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a look of\\nutmost terror on his face.\\n\\n\"Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!\"\\n\\n\"What?\"\\n\\n\"Here! Just now! Slashed the curtains! Woke me up!\"\\n\\n\"You sure you weren\\'t dreaming, Ron?\" said Dean.\\n\\n\"Look at the curtains! I tell you, he was here!\"\\n\\nThey all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory door first,\\nand they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened behind them, and\\nsleepy voices called after them.\\n\\n\"Who shouted?\"\\n\\n\"What\\'re you doing?\"\\n\\nThe common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still littered\\nwith the debris from the party. It was deserted.\\n\\n\"Are you sure you weren\\'t dreaming, Ron?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m telling you, I saw him!\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s all the noise?\"\\n\\n\"Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!\"\\n\\nA few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling or, dressing\\ngowns and yawning. Boys, too, were reappearing.\\n\\n\"Excellent, are we carrying on?\" said Fred Weasley brightly.\\n\\n\"Everyone back upstairs!\" said Percy, hurrying into the common room and\\npinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as he spoke.\\n\\n\"Perce -- Sirius Black!\" said Ron faintly. \"In our dormitory! With a\\nknife! Woke me up!\"\\n\\nThe common room went very still.\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" said Percy, looking startled. \"You had too much to eat, Ron\\n-- had a nightmare --\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m telling you --\"\\n\\n\"Now, really, enough\\'s enough!\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait behind her as\\nshe entered the common room and stared furiously around.\\n\\n\"I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is getting\\nridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!\"\\n\\n\"I certainly didn\\'t authorize this, Professor!\" said Percy, puffing\\nhimself up indignantly. \"I was just telling them all to get back to bed!\\nMy brother Ron here had a nightmare --\"\\n\\n\"IT WASN\\'T A NIGHTMARE!\" Ron yelled. \"PROFESSOR, I WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS\\nBLACK WAS STANDING OVER ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall stared at him.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have gotten through\\nthe portrait hole?\"\\n\\n\"Ask him!\" said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir\\nCadogan\\'s picture. \"Ask him if he saw --\"\\n\\nGlaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the Portrait\\nback open and went outside. The whole common room listened with bated\\nbreath. \"Sir Cadogan, did you just let a man enter Gryffindor Tower?\"\\n\"Certainly, good lady!\" cried Sir Cadogan.\\n\\nThere was a stunned silence, both inside and outside the common room.\\n\\n\"You -- you did?\" said Professor McGonagall. \"But -- but the password!\"\\n\\n\"He had \\'em!\" said Sir Cadogan proudly. \"Had the whole week\\'s, my lady!\\nRead \\'em off a little piece of paper!\"\\n\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled herself back through the portrait hole to\\nface the stunned crowd. She was white as chalk.\\n\\n\"Which person,\" she said, her voice shaking, \"which abysmally foolish\\nperson wrote down this week\\'s passwords and left them lying around?\"\\n\\nThere was utter silence, broken by the smallest of terrified squeaks.\\nNeville Longbottom, trembling from head to fluffy slippered toes, raised\\nhis hand slowly into the air.\\n\\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN\\n\\nSNAPE\\'S GRUDGE\\n\\nNo one in Gryffindor Tower slept that night. They knew that the castle\\nwas being searched again, and the whole House stayed awake in the common\\nroom, waiting to hear whether Black had been caught. Professor\\nMcGonagall came back at dawn, to tell them that he had again escaped.\\n\\nThroughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter\\nsecurity; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to\\nrecognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was suddenly bustling\\nup and down the corridors, boarding up everything from tiny cracks in\\nthe walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been fired. His portrait had\\nbeen taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor, and the Fat\\nLady was back. She had been expertly restored, but was still extremely\\nnervous, and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she\\nwas given extra protection. A bunch of surly security trolls had been\\nhired to guard her. They paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking\\nin grunts and comparing the size of their clubs.\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed witch on\\nthe third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred\\nand George had been right in thinking that they -- and now Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione -- were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway\\nwithin it.\\n\\n\"D\\'you reckon we should tell someone?\" Harry asked Ron.\\n\\n\"We know he\\'s not coming in through Honeyduke\\'s,\" said Ron dismissively.\\n\"We\\'d\\'ve heard if the shop had been broken into.\"\\n\\nHarry was glad Ron took this view. If the one-eyed witch was boarded up\\ntoo, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade again.\\n\\nRon had become an instant celebrity. For the first time in his life,\\npeople were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear\\nthat Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though still severely\\nshaken by the night\\'s events, he was happy to tell anyone who asked what\\nhad happened, with a wealth of detail.\\n\\n\"... I was asleep, and I heard this ripping noise, and I thought it was\\nin my dream, you know? But then there was this draft... I woke up and\\none side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled down.... I rolled\\nover... and I saw him standing over me... like a skeleton, with loads of\\nfilthy hair ... holding this great long knife, must\\'ve been twelve\\ninches... and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and then I yelled,\\nand he scampered.\\n\\n\"Why, though?\" Ron added to Harry as the group of secondyear girls who\\nhad been listening to his chilling tale departed. \"Why did he run?\"\\n\\nHarry had been wondering the same thing. Why had Black, having got the\\nwrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to Harry? Black had proved\\ntwelve years ago that he didn\\'t mind murdering innocent people, and this\\ntime he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.\\n\\n\"He must\\'ve known he\\'d have a job getting back out of the castle once\\nyou\\'d yelled and woken people up,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\'d\\'ve had\\nto kill the whole House to get back through the portrait hole... then he\\nwould\\' ve met the teachers....\"\\n\\nNeville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furious with\\nhim she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade visits, given him a\\ndetention, and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower.\\nPoor Neville was forced to wait. outside the common room every night for\\nsomebody to let him in, while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at\\nhim. None of these punishments, however, came close to matching the one\\nhis grandmother had in store for him. Two days after Black\\'s break-in,\\nshe sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive\\nover breakfast -- a Howler.\\n\\nThe school owls swooped into the Great Hall carrying the mail as usual,\\nand Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him, a scarlet\\nenvelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, who were sitting opposite\\nhim, recognized the letter as a Howler at once -- Ron had got one from\\nhis mother the year before.\\n\\n\"Run for it, Neville,\" Ron advised.\\n\\nNeville didn\\'t need telling twice. He seized the envelope, and holding\\nit before him like a bomb, sprinted out of the hall, while the Slytherin\\ntable exploded with laughter at the sight of him. They heard the Howler\\ngo off in the entrance hall -- Neville\\'s grandmother\\'s voice, magically\\nmagnified to a hundred times its Usual volume, shrieking about how he\\nhad brought shame on the whole family.\\n\\nHarry was too busy feeling sorry for Neville to notice immediately that\\nhe had a letter too. Hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on\\nthe wrist.\\n\\n\"Ouch! Oh -- thanks, Hedwig.\"\\n\\nHarry tore open the envelope while Hedwig helped herself to some of\\nNeville\\'s cornflakes. The note inside said:\\n\\nDear Harry and Ron, How Abut having tea with me this afternoon \\'round\\nsix? I\\'ll come collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE\\nHALL; YOU\\'RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, Hagrid\\n\\n\"He probably wants to hear all about Black!\" said Ron.\\n\\nSo at six o\\'clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor Tower,\\npassed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the entrance\\nhall.\\n\\nHagrid was already waiting for them.\\n\\n\"All right, Hagrid!\" said Ron. \"S\\'pose you want to hear about Saturday\\nnight, do you?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve already heard all abou\\' it,\" said Hagrid, opening the front doors\\nand leading them outside.\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Ron, looking slightly put out.\\n\\nThe first thing they saw on entering Hagrid\\'s cabin was Buckbeak, who\\nwas stretched out on top of Hagrid\\'s patchwork quilt, his enormous wings\\nfolded tight to his body, enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets.\\nAverting his eyes from this unpleasant sight, Harry saw a gigantic,\\nhairy brown suit and a very horrible yellow-and-orange tie hanging from\\nthe top of Hagrid\\'s wardrobe door.\\n\\n\"What are they for, Hagrid?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Buckbeaks case against the Committee fer the Disposal o\\' Dangerous\\nCreatures,\" said Hagrid. \"This Friday. Him an\\' me\\'ll be goin\\' down ter\\nLondon together. I\\'ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus....\"\\n\\nHarry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten that\\nBuckbeak\\'s trial was so near, and judging by the uneasy look on Ron\\'s\\nface, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise about helping\\nhim prepare Buckbeak\\'s defense; the arrival of the Firebolt had driven\\nit clean out of their minds.\\n\\nHagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns but they\\nknew better than to accept; they had had too much experience with\\nHagrid\\'s cooking.\\n\\nI got somethin\\' ter discuss with you two,\" said Hagrid, sitting himself\\nbetween them and looking uncharacteristically serious.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Hermione,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\n\"What about her?\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"She\\'s in a righ\\' state, that\\'s what. She\\'s bin comin\\' down ter visit me\\na lot since Chris\\'mas. Bin feelin\\' lonely. Firs\\' yeh weren\\' talking to\\nher because o\\' the Firebolt, now yer not talkin\\' to her because her cat\\n--\"\\n\\n\"-- ate Scabbers!\" Ron interjected angrily.\\n\\n\"Because her cat acted like all cats do,\" Hagrid continued doggedly.\\n\"She\\'s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin\\' through a rough time at\\nthe moment. Bitten off more\\'n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work\\nshe\\'s tryin\\' ter do. Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak\\'s case,\\nmind.... She\\'s found some really good stuff fer me... reckon he\\'ll stand\\na good chance now...\"\\n\\n\"Hagrid, we should\\'ve helped as well -- sorry --\" Harry began awkwardly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blamin\\' yeh!\" said Hagrid, waving Harry\\'s apology aside. \"Gawd\\nknows yeh\\'ve had enough ter be gettin\\' on with. I\\'ve seen yeh practicin\\'\\nQuidditch ev\\'ry hour o\\' the day an\\' night -- but I gotta tell yeh, I\\nthought you two\\'d value yer friend more\\'n broomsticks or rats. Tha\\'s\\nall.\"\\n\\nHarry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks.\\n\\n\"Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. She\\'s got\\nher heart in the right place, Hermione has, an\\' you two not talkin\\' to\\nher --\"\\n\\n\"If she\\'d just get rid of that cat, I\\'d speak to her again!\" Ron said\\nangrily. \"But she\\'s still sticking up for it! It\\'s a maniac, and she\\nwon\\'t hear a word against it!\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou\\' their pets,\" said Hagrid\\nwisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid\\'s\\npillow.\\n\\nThey spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor\\'s improved\\nchances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o\\'clock, Hagrid walked them back\\nup to the castle.\\n\\nA large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they\\nreturned to the common room.\\n\\n\"Hogsmeade, next weekend!\" said Ron, craning over the heads to read the\\nnew notice. \"What d\\'you reckon?\" he added quietly to Harry as they went\\nto sit down.\\n\\n\"Well, Filch hasn\\'t done anything about the passage into Honeydukes....\"\\nHarry said, even more quietly.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked around\\nat Hermione, who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing\\na space in the wall of books that had been hiding her.\\n\\n\"Harry, if you go into Hogsmeade again... I\\'ll tell Professor McGonagall\\nabout that map!\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"Can you hear someone talking, Harry?\" growled Ron, not looking at\\nHermione.\\n\\n\"Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black nearly\\ndid to you! I mean it, I\\'ll tell --\"\\n\\n\"So now you\\'re trying to get Harry expelled!\" said Ron furiously.\\n\"Haven\\'t you done enough damage this year?\"\\n\\nHermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, Crookshanks\\nleapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened look at the expression\\non Ron\\'s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and hurried away toward the\\ngirls\\' dormitories.\\n\\n\"So how about it?\" Ron said to Harry as though there had been no\\ninterruption. \"Come on, last time we went you didn\\'t see anything. You\\nhaven\\'t even been inside Zonko\\'s yet!\"\\n\\nHarry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of earshot.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"But I\\'m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.\"\\n\\nOn Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag,\\nslipped the Marauder\\'s Map into his pocket, and went down to breakfast\\nwith everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the\\ntable at him, but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him\\nwalking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody\\nelse proceeded to the front doors.\\n\\n\"\\'Bye!\" Harry called to Ron. \"See you when you get back!\"\\n\\nRon grinned and winked.\\n\\nHarry hurried up to the third floor, slipping the Marauder\\'s Map out of\\nhis pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed witch, he smoothed\\nit out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. Harry squinted at it.\\nThe minuscule writing next to it read Neville Longbottom.\\n\\nHarry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, \"Dissendium!\" and shoved\\nhis bag into the statue, but before he could climb in himself, Neville\\ncame around the corner.\\n\\n\"Harry! I forgot you weren\\'t going to Hogsmeade either!\"\\n\\n\"Hi, Neville,\" said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue and\\npushing the map back into his pocket. \"What are you up to?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing,\" shrugged Neville. \"Want a game of Exploding Snap?\"\\n\\n\"Er -- not now -- I was going to go to the library and do that vampire\\nessay for Lupin --\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come with you!\" said Neville brightly. I haven\\'t done it either!\"\\n\\n\"Er -- hang on -- yeah, I forgot, I finished it last night!\"\\n\\n\"Great, you can help me!\" said Neville, his round face anxious. \"I don\\'t\\nunderstand that thing about the garlic at all -- do they have to eat it,\\nor --\"\\n\\nHe broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry\\'s shoulder.\\n\\nIt was Snape. Neville took a quick step behind Harry.\\n\\n\"And what are you two doing here?\" said Snape, coming to a halt and\\nlooking from one to the other. \"An odd place to meet --\"\\n\\nTo Harry\\'s immense disquiet, Snape\\'s black eyes flicked to the doorways\\non either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not -- meeting here,\" said Harry. \"We just -- met here.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Snape. \"You have a habit of turning up in unexpected\\nplaces, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good reason.... I\\nsuggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.\"\\n\\nHarry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned the\\ncorner, Harry looked back. Snape was running one of his hands over the\\none-eyed witch\\'s head, examining it closely.\\n\\nHarry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by telling him the\\npassword, then pretending he\\'d left his vampire essay in the library and\\ndoubling back. Once out of sight of the security trolls, he pulled out\\nthe map again and held it close to his nose.\\n\\nThe third floor corridor seemed to be deserted. Harry scanned the map\\ncarefully and saw, with a leap of relief, that the tiny dot labeled\\nSeverus Snape was now back in its office.\\n\\nHe sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, heaved himself\\ninside, and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute.\\nHe wiped the Marauder\\'s Map blank again, then set off at a run.\\n\\nHarry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into\\nthe sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.\\n\\nIt\\'s me,\" he muttered.\\n\\n\"What kept you?\" Ron hissed.\\n\\n\"Snape was hanging around.\"\\n\\nThey set off up the High Street.\\n\\n\"Where are you?\" Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth. \"Are\\nyou still there? This feels weird....\"\\n\\nThey went to the post office; Ron pretended to be checking the price of\\nan owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good look around. The\\nowls sat hooting softly down at him, at least three hundred of them;\\nfrom Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops owls (\"Local Deliveries\\nOnly\"), which were so small they could have sat in the palm of Harry\\'s\\nhand.\\n\\nThen they visited Zonko\\'s, which was so packed with students Harry had\\nto exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic. There\\nwere jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred\\'s and George\\'s wildest\\ndreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from\\nunder the cloak. They left Zonko\\'s with their money bags considerably\\nlighter than they had been on entering, but their pockets bulging with\\nDungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup\\napiece.\\n\\nThe day was fine and breezy, and neither of them felt like staying\\nindoors, so they walked past the Three Broomsticks and climbed a slope\\nto visit the Shrieking Shack, the most haunted dwelling in Britain. It\\nstood a little way above the rest of the village, and even in daylight\\nwas slightly creepy, with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden.\\n\\n\"Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it,\" said Ron as they leaned on the\\nfence, looking up at it. \"I asked Nearly Headless Nick... he says he\\'s\\nheard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and George\\ntried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut....\"\\n\\nHarry, feeling hot from their climb, was just considering taking off the\\ncloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. Someone was\\nclimbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments\\nlater, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy\\nwas speaking.\\n\\n\"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the\\nhearing to tell them about my arm... about how I couldn\\'t use it for\\nthree months....\"\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle sniggered.\\n\\n\"I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend\\nhimself... \\'There\\'s no \\'arm in \\'im, \\'onest that hippogriff\\'s as good as\\ndead --\"\\n\\nMalfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent\\ngrin.\\n\\n\"What are you doing, Weasley?\"\\n\\nMalfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.\\n\\n\"Suppose You\\'d love to live here, wouldn\\'t you, Weasley? Dreaming about\\nhaving your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- is\\nthat true?\"\\n\\nHarry seized the back of Ron\\'s robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.\\n\"Leave him to me,\" he hissed in Ron\\'s ear.\\n\\nThe opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around\\nbehind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful\\nof mud out of the path.\\n\\n\"We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,\" Malfoy said to Ron. \"Just\\ntrying to imagine what he\\'s saying to the Committee for the Disposal of\\nDangerous Creatures. D\\'you think he\\'ll cry when they cut off his\\nhippogriff\\'s\\n\\nSPLAT.\\n\\nMalfoy\\'s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silverblond hair\\nwas suddenly dripping in muck.\\n\\n\"What the --?\"\\n\\nRon had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was laughing\\nso hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring\\nwildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean.\\n\\n\"What was that? \\'Who did that?\"\\n\\n\"Very haunted up here, isn\\'t it?\" said Ron, with the air of one\\ncommenting on the weather.\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles were no use\\nagainst ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted\\nlandscape.\\n\\nHarry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded\\nsome foul-smelling, green sludge.\\n\\nSPLATTER.\\n\\nCrabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furiously on the\\nspot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes.\\n\\n\"It came from over there!\" said Malfoy, wiping his face, and staring at\\na spot some six feet to the left of Harry.\\n\\nCrabbe blundered forward, his long arms outstretched like a zombie.\\nHarry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed it at Crabbe\\'s\\nback. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as Crabbe did a kind of\\npirouette in midair, trying to see who had thrown it. As Ron was the\\nonly person Crabbe could see, it was Ron he started toward, but Harry\\nstuck out his leg. Crabbe stumbled -- and his huge, flat foot caught the\\nhem of Harry\\'s cloak. Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off\\nhis face.\\n\\nFor a split second, Malfoy stared at him.\\n\\n\"AAARGH!\" he yelled, pointing at Harry\\'s head. Then he turned tail and\\nran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe and Goyle behind\\nhim.\\n\\nHarry tugged the cloak up again, but the damage was done.\\n\\n\"Harry!\" Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point\\nwhere Harry had disappeared, \"you\\'d better run for it! If Malfoy tells\\nanyone -- you\\'d better get back to the castle, quick --\" \"See you\\nlater,\" said Harry, and without another word, he tore back down the path\\ntoward Hogsmeade.\\n\\nWould Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe\\n\\nMalfoy? Nobody knew about the Invisibility Cloak -- nobody except\\nDumbledore. Harry\\'s stomach turned over -- Dumbledore would know exactly\\nwhat had happened, if Malfoy said any- thing --\\n\\nBack into Honeydukes, back down the cellar steps, across the stone\\nfloor, through the trapdoor -- Harry pulled off the cloak, tucked it\\nunder his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage.... Malfoy would get\\nback first... how long would it take him to find a teacher? Panting, a\\nsharp pain in his side, Harry didn\\'t slow down until he reached the\\nstone slide. He would have to leave the cloak where it was, it was too\\nmuch of a giveaway in case Malfoy had tipped off a teacher -- he hid it\\nin a shadowy corner, then started to climb, fast as he could, his sweaty\\nhands slipping on the sides of the chute. He reached the inside of the\\nwitch\\'s hump, tapped it with his wand, stuck his head through, and\\nhoisted himself out; the hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from\\nbehind the statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching.\\n\\nIt was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black robes\\nswishing, then stopped in front of him.\\n\\n\"So,\" he said.\\n\\nThere was a look of surpressed triumph about him. Harry tried to look\\ninnocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he\\nquickly hid in his pockets.\\n\\n\"Come with me, Potter,\" said Snape.\\n\\nHarry followed him downstairs, trying to wipe his hands clean on the\\ninside of his robes without Snape noticing. They walked down the stairs\\nto the dungeons and then into Snape\\'s office.\\n\\nHarry had been in here only once before, and he had been in very serious\\ntrouble then too. Snape had aquired a few more slimy horrible things in\\njars since last time, all standing on shelves behind his desk, glinting\\nin the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere.\\n\\n\"Sit,\" said Snape.\\n\\nHarry sat. Snape, however, remained, standing.\\n\\n\"Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,\" said\\nSnape.\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t say anything.\\n\\n\"He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran into\\nWeasley -- apparently alone.\"\\n\\nStill, Harry didn\\'t speak.\\n\\n\"Mr. Malfoy states that he was standing talking to Weasley, when a large\\namount of mud hit him in the back of the head. How do you think that\\ncould have happened?\"\\n\\nHarry tried to look mildly surprised.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Professor.\"\\n\\nSnape\\'s eyes were boring into Harry\\'s. It was exactly like trying to\\nstare down a hippogriff. Harry tried hard not to blink.\\n\\n\"Mr. Malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition. Can you imagine what\\nit might have been, Potter?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious.\\n\\n\"It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.\"\\n\\nThere was a long silence.\\n\\n\"Maybe he\\'d better go to Madam Pomfrey,\" said Harry. \"If he\\'s seeing\\nthings like --\"\\n\\n\"What would your head have been doing in Hogsmeade, Potter?\" said Snape\\nsoftly. \"Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. No part of your body has\\npermission to be in Hogsmeade.\"\\n\\n\"I know that,\" said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt or\\nfear. \"It sounds like Malfoy\\'s having hallucin --\"\\n\\n\"Malfoy is not having hallucinations,\" snarled Snape, and he bent down,\\na hand on each arm of Harry\\'s chair, so that their faces were a foot\\napart. \"If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest of you.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,\" said Harry. \"Like you told --\" \"Can\\nanyone confirm that?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t say anything. Snape\\'s thin mouth curled into a horrible\\nsmile.\\n\\n\"So,\" he said, straightening up again. \"Everyone from the Minister of\\nMagic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry Potter safe from\\nSirius Black. But famous Harry Potter is a law unto himself Let the\\nordinary people worry about his safety! Famous Harry Potter goes where\\nhe wants to, with no thought for the consequences.\\n\\nHarry stayed silent. Snape was trying to provoke him into telling the\\ntruth. He wasn\\'t going to do it. Snape had no proof -- yet.\\n\\n\"How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,\" Snape said\\nsuddenly, his eyes glinting. \"He too was exceedingly arrogant. A small\\namount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think he was a cut\\nabove the rest of us too. Strutting around the place with his friends\\nand admirers... The resemblance between you is uncanny.\"\\n\\n\"My dad didn\\'t strut,\" said Harry, before he could stop himself. \"And\\nneither do I.\"\\n\\n\"Your father didn\\'t set much store by rules either,\" Snape went on,\\npressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. \"Rules were for\\nlesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen --\"\\n\\n\"SHUT UP!\"\\n\\nHarry was suddenly on his feet. Rage such as he had not felt since his\\nlast night in Privet Drive was coursing through him. He didn\\'t care that\\nSnape\\'s face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously.\\n\\n\"What did you say to me, Potter?\"\\n\\n\"I told you to shut up about my dad!\" Harry yelled. I know the truth,\\nall right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You wouldn\\'t even be\\nhere if it wasn\\'t for my dad!\"\\n\\nSnape\\'s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.\\n\\n\"And did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father\\nsaved my life?\" he whispered. \"Or did he consider the details too\\nunpleasant for precious Potter\\'s delicate ears?\"\\n\\nHarry bit his lip. He didn\\'t know what had happened and didn\\'t want to\\nadmit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth.\\n\\nI would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father,\\nPotter,\" he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. \"Have you been\\nimagining some act of glorious heroism? Then let me correct you -- your\\nsaintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that\\nwould have resulted in my death if your father hadn\\'t got cold feet at\\nthe last moment. There was nothing brave about what he did. He was\\nsaving his own skin as much as mine. Had their joke succeeded, he would\\nhave been expelled from Hogwarts.\"\\n\\nSnape\\'s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.\\n\\n\"Turn out your pockets, Potter!\" he spat suddenly.\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t move. There was a pounding in his ears.\\n\\n\"Turn out your pockets, or we go straight to the headmaster! Pull them\\nout, Potter!\"\\n\\nCold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko\\'s tricks and\\nthe Marauder\\'s Map.\\n\\nSnap picked up the Zonko\\'s bag.\\n\\n\"Ron gave them to me,\" said Harry, praying he\\'d get a chance to tip Ron\\noff before Snape saw him. \"He -brought them back from Hogsmeade last\\ntime --\"\\n\\n\"Indeed? And you\\'ve been carrying them around ever since? How very\\ntouching... and what is this?\"\\n\\nSnape had picked up the map. Harry tried with all his might to keep his\\nface impassive.\\n\\n\"Spare bit of parchment,\" he said with a shrug.\\n\\nSnape turned it over, his eyes on Harry.\\n\\n\"Surely you don\\'t need such a very old piece of parchment?\" he said.\\n\"Why don\\'t I just -- throw this away?\"\\n\\nHis hand moved toward the fire.\\n\\n\"No!\" Harry said quickly.\\n\\n\"So!\" said Snape, his long nostrils quivering. \"Is this another\\ntreasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it -- something else? A letter,\\nperhaps, written in invisible ink? Or -- instructions to get into\\nHogsmeade without passing the dementors?\"\\n\\nHarry blinked. Snape\\'s eyes gleamed.\\n\\n\"Let me see, let me see....\" he muttered, taking out his wand and\\nsmoothing the map out on his desk. \"Reveal your secret!\" he said,\\ntouching the wand to the parchment.\\n\\nNothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking.\\n\\n\"Show yourself!\" Snape said, tapping the map sharply.\\n\\nIt stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths.\\n\\n\"Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you to yield\\nthe information you conceal!\" Snape said, hitting the map with his wand.\\n\\nAs though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words appeared on the\\nsmooth surface of the map.\\n\\nMooney presents his compliments to Professor Snape, and begs him to keep\\nhis abnormally large nose out of other people\\'s business.\"\\n\\nSnape froze. Harry stared, dumbstruck, at the message. But the map\\ndidn\\'t stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the first.\\n\\n\"Mr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony and would like to add that Professor\\nSnape is an ugle git.\"\\n\\nIt would have been very funny if the situation hadn\\'t been so serious.\\nAnd there was more....\\n\\n\"Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like\\nthat ever became a professor.\"\\n\\nHarry closed his eyes in horror. When he\\'d opened them, the map had had\\nits last word.\\n\\n\"Mr. Wormtail bids Professor Snape good day, and advises him to wash his\\nhair , the slimeball.\"\\n\\nHarry waited for the blow to fall.\\n\\n\"So...\" said Snape softly. \"We\\'ll see about this....\"\\n\\nHe strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder from\\na jar on the fireplace, and threw it into the flames.\\n\\n\"Lupin!\" Snape called into the fire. \"I want a word!\"\\n\\nUtterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had appeared\\nin it, revolving very fast. Seconds later, Professor Lupin was\\nclambering out of the fireplace, brushing ash off his shabby robes.\\n\\n\"You called, Severus?\" said Lupin mildly.\\n\\n\"I certainly did,\" said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he strode\\nback to his desk. \"I have just asked Potter to empty his pockets. He was\\ncarrying this.\"\\n\\nSnape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. Moony,\\nWormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were still shining. An odd, closed\\nexpression appeared on Lupin\\'s face.\\n\\n\"Well?\" said Snape.\\n\\nLupin continued to stare at the map. Harry had the impression that Lupin\\nwas doing some very quick thinking.\\n\\n\"Well?\" said Snape again. \"This parchment is plainly full of Dark Magic.\\nThis is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where do you\\nimagine Potter got such a thing?\"\\n\\nLupin looked up and, by the merest half-glance in Harry\\'s direction,\\nwarned him not to interrupt.\\n\\n\"Full of Dark Magic?\" he repeated mildly. \"Do you really think so,\\nSeverus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that\\ninsults anybody who reads it. Childish, but surely not dangerous? I\\nimagine Harry got it from a joke shop --\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Snape. His jaw had gone rigid with anger. \"You think a\\njoke shop could supply him with such a thing? You don\\'t think it more\\nlikely that he got it directly from the manufacturers?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t understand what Snape was talking about. Nor, apparently,\\ndid Lupin.\\n\\n\"You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?\" he said. \"Harry, do\\nyou know any of these men?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry quickly.\\n\\n\"You see, Severus?\" said Lupin, turning back to Snape. \"It looks like a\\nZonko product to me --\"\\n\\nRight on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was completely out\\nof breath, and stopped just short of Snape\\'s desk, clutching the stitch\\nin his chest and trying to speak.\\n\\n\"I -- gave -- Harry -- that -- stuff,\" he choked. \"Bought -- it... in\\nZonko\\'s... ages -- ago...\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking around\\ncheerfully. \"That seems to clear that up! Severus, I\\'ll take this back,\\nshall I?\" He folded the map and tucked it inside his robes. \"Harry, Ron,\\ncome with me, I need a word about my vampire essay -- excuse us, Severus\\n--\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t dare look at Snape as they left his office. He. Ron, and\\nLupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking.\\nThen Harry turned to Lupin.\\n\\n\"Professor, I --\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear explanations,\" said Lupin shortly. He glanced\\naround the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. \"I happen to know\\nthat this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know\\nit\\' s a map,\" he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. \"I don\\'t want to\\nknow how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you\\ndidn\\'t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a\\nstudent left information about the castle lying around. And I can\\'t let\\nyou have it back, Harry.\"\\n\\nHarry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to protest.\\n\\n\"Why did Snape think I\\'d got it from the manufacturers?\"\\n\\n\"Because...,\" Lupin hesitated, \"because these mapmakers would have\\nwanted to lure you out of school. They\\'d think it extremely\\nentertaining.\"\\n\\n\"Do you know them?\" said Harry, impressed.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve met,\" he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more seriously\\nthan ever before.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot make you\\ntake Sirius Black seriously. But I would have thought that what you have\\nheard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect\\non you. Your parents gave their lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor\\nway to repay them -- gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic\\ntricks.\"\\n\\nHe walked away, leaving Harry feeling worse by far than he had at any\\npoint in Snape\\'s office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the marble\\nstaircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remembered the\\nInvisibility Cloak -- it was still down there, but he didn\\'t dare go and\\nget it.\\n\\n\"It\\'s my fault,\" said Ron abruptly. \"I persuaded you to go. Lupin\\'s\\nright, it was stupid, we shouldn\\'t\\'ve done it --\"\\n\\nHe broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls were\\npacing, and Hermione was walking toward them. One look at her face\\nconvinced Harry that she had heard what had happened. His heart\\nplummeted -- had she told Professor McGonagall?\\n\\n\"Come to have a good gloat?\" said Ron savagely as she stopped in front\\nof them. \"Or have you just been to tell on us?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Hermione. She was holding a letter in her hands and her lip\\nwas trembling. \"I just thought you ought to know... Hagrid lost his\\ncase. Buckbeak is going to be executed.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\\n\\nTHE QUIDDITCH FINAL\\n\\nHe sent me this,\" Hermione said, holding out the letter.\\n\\nHarry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous teardrops had\\nsmudged the ink so badly in places that it was very difficult to read.\\n\\nDear Hermione, We lost. I\\'m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts.\\nExecution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London. I won\\'t forget all\\nthe help you gave us.\\n\\nHagrid\\n\\n\"They can\\'t do this,\" said Harry. \"They can\\'t. Buckbeak isn\\'t\\ndangerous.\"\\n\\n\"Malfoy\\'s dad\\'s frightened the Committee into it,\" said Hermione, wiping\\nher eyes. \"You know what he\\'s like. They\\'re a bunch of doddery old\\nfools, and they were scared. There\\'ll be an appeal, though, there always\\nis. Only I can\\'t see any hope.... Nothing will have changed.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, it will,\" said Ron fiercely. \"You won\\'t have to do all the work\\nalone this time, Hermione. I\\'ll help.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Ron!\"\\n\\nHermione flung her arms around Ron\\'s neck and broke down completely.\\nRon, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of\\nthe head. Finally, Hermione drew away.\\n\\n\"Ron, I\\'m really, really sorry about Scabbers...\" she sobbed.\\n\\n\"Oh -- well -- he was old,\" said Ron, looking thoroughly relieved that\\nshe had let go of him. \"And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum\\nand Dad might get me an owl now.\"\\n\\nThe safety measures imposed on the students since Black\\'s second\\nbreak-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go and visit\\nHagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to him was during\\nCare of Magical Creatures lessons.\\n\\nHe seemed numb with shock at the verdict.\\n\\n\"S\\'all my fault. Got all tongue-tied. They was all sittin\\' there in\\nblack robes an\\' I kep\\' droppin\\' me notes and forgettin\\' all them dates\\nyeh looked up fer me, Hermione. An\\' then Lucius Malfoy stood up an\\' said\\nhis bit, and the Committee jus\\' did exac\\'ly what he told \\'em....\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s still the appeal!\" said Ron fiercely. \"Don\\'t give up Yet, we\\'re\\nworking on it!\"\\n\\nThey were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the class.\\nAhead they could see Malfoy, who was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, and\\nkept looking back, laughing derisively.\\n\\n\"S\\'no good, Ron,\" said Hagrid sadly as they reached the castle steps.\\n\"That Committee\\'s in Lucius Malfoy\\'s pocket. I\\'m jus\\' gonna make sure\\nthe rest o\\' Beaky\\'s time is the happiest he\\'s ever had. I owe him\\nthat....\"\\n\\nHagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his face buried\\nin his handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Look at him blubber!\"\\n\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the castle\\ndoors, listening.\\n\\n\"Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?\" said Malfoy. \"And he\\'s\\nsupposed to be our teacher!\"\\n\\nHarry and Ron both made furious moves toward Malfoy, but Hermione got\\nthere first -- SMACK!\\n\\nShe had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she could\\nmuster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle stood\\nflabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul -- you evil --\"\\n\\n\"Hermione!\" said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as she swung\\nit back.\\n\\n\"Get off, Ron!\"\\n\\nHermione pulled out her wand. Malfoy stepped backward. Crabbe and Goyle\\nlooked at him for instructions, thoroughly bewildered.\\n\\n\"C\\'mon,\" Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them had\\ndisappeared into the passageway to the dungeons.\\n\\n\"Hermione!\" Ron said again, sounding both stunned and irnpressed.\\n\\n\"Harry, you\\'d better beat him in the Quidditch final!\" Hermione said\\nshrilly. \"You just better had, because I can\\'t stand it if Slytherin\\nwins!\"\\n\\n\"We\\'re due in Charms,\" said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. \"We\\'d\\nbetter go.\"\\n\\nThey hurried up the marble staircase toward Professor Flitwick\\'s\\nclassroom.\\n\\n\"You\\'re late, boys!\" said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry opened\\nthe classroom door. \"Come along, quickly, wands out, we\\'re experimenting\\nwith Cheering Charms today, we\\'ve already divided into pairs --\"\\n\\nHarry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their bags. Ron\\nlooked behind him.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Hermione gone?\"\\n\\nHarry looked around too. Hermione hadn\\'t entered the classroom, yet\\nHarry knew she had been right next to him when he had opened the door.\\n\\n\"That\\'s weird,\" said Harry, staring at Ron. \"Maybe -- maybe she went to\\nthe bathroom or something?\"\\n\\nBut Hermione didn\\'t turn up all lesson.\\n\\n\"She could\\'ve done with a Cheering Charm on her too,\" said Ron as the\\nclass left for lunch, all grinning broadly -- the Cheering Charms had\\nleft them with a feeling of great contentment.\\n\\nHermione wasn\\'t at lunch either. By the time they had finished their\\napple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wearing off,\\nand Harry and Ron had started to get slightly worried.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t think Malfoy did something to her?\" Ron said anxiously as\\nthey hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower.\\n\\nThey passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password\\n(\"Flibbertigibbet\"), and scrambled through the portrait hole into the\\ncommon room.\\n\\nHermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep, her head resting on an\\nopen Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of her. Harry\\nprodded her awake.\\n\\n\"Wh -- what?\" said Hermione, waking with a start and staring wildly\\naround. \"Is it time to go? W -- which lesson have we got now?\"\\n\\n\"Divination, but it\\'s not for another twenty minutes,\" said Harry.\\n\"Hermione, why didn\\'t you come to Charms?\"\\n\\n\"What? Oh no!\" Hermione squeaked. \"I forgot to go to Charms!\"\\n\\n\"But how could you forget?\" said Harry. \"You were with us till we were\\nright outside the classroom!\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe it!\" Hermione wailed. \"Was Professor Flitwick angry?\\nOh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!\"\\n\\n\"You know what, Hermione?\" said Ron, looking down at the enormous\\nArithmancy book Hermione had been using as a pillow. \"I reckon you\\'re\\ncracking up. You\\'re trying to do too much.\"\\n\\n\"No, I\\'m not!\" said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes and\\nstaring hopelessly around for her bag. \"I just made a mistake, that\\'s\\nall! I\\'d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry... I\\'ll see\\nyou in Divination!\"\\n\\nHermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawneys\\nclassroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our\\nexams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!\"\\n\\nTogether they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room.\\nGlowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly white\\nmist. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down together at the same rickety\\ntable.\\n\\n\"I thought we weren\\'t starting crystal balls until next term,\" Ron\\nmuttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in case she\\nwas lurking nearby.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t complain, this means we\\'ve finished palmistry,\" Harry muttered\\nback. \"I was getting sick of her flinching every time she looked at my\\nhands.\"\\n\\n\"Good day to you!\" said the familiar, misty voice, and Professor\\nTrelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. Parvati\\nand Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by the milky glow\\nof their crystal ball.\\n\\n\"I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I\\nhad planned,\" said Professor Trelawney, sitting with her back to the\\nfire and gazing around. \"The fates have informed me that your\\nexamination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you\\nsufficient practice.\"\\n\\nHermione snorted.\\n\\n\"Well, honestly... \\'the fates have informed her\\' who sets the exam? She\\ndoes! What an amazing prediction!\" she said, not troubling to keep her\\nvoice low. Harry and Ron choked back laughs.\\n\\nIt was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them as her\\nface was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as though she had\\nnot.\\n\\n\"Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art,\" she said dreamily. \"I do\\nnot expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb\\'s infinite\\ndepths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and\\nexternal eyes\" -- Ron began to snigger uncontrollably and had to stuff\\nhis fist in his mouth to stifle the noise -- \"so as to clear the Inner\\nEye and the superconscious. Perhaps, if we are lucky, some of you will\\nsee before the end of the class.\"\\n\\nAnd so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring\\nblankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when thoughts\\nsuch as \"this is stupid\" kept drifting across it. It didn\\'t help that\\nRon kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept tutting.\\n\\n\"Seen anything yet?\" Harry asked them after a quarter of an hour\\'s quiet\\ncrystal gazing.\\n\\n\"Yeah, there\\'s a burn on this table,\" said Ron, pointing. \"Someone\\'s\\nspilled their candle.\"\\n\\n\"This is such a waste of time,\" Hermione hissed. \"I could be practicing\\nsomething useful. I could be catching up on Cheering Charms --\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney rustled past.\\n\\n\"Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within\\ntheir Orb?\" she murmured over the clinking of her bangles.\\n\\nI don\\'t need help,\" Ron whispered. \"It\\'s obvious what this means.\\nThere\\'s going to be loads of fog tonight.\"\\n\\nBoth Harry and Hermione burst out laughing.\\n\\n\"Now, really!\" said Professor Trelawney as everyone\\'s heads turned in\\ntheir direction. Parvati and Lavender were looking scandalized. \"You are\\ndisturbing the clairvoyant vibrations!\" She approached their table and\\npeered into their crystal ball. Harry felt his heart sinking. He was\\nsure he knew what was coming --\\n\\n\"There is something here!\" Professor Trelawney whispered, lowerng her\\nface to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge glasses.\\n\"Something moving... but what is it?\"\\n\\nHarry was prepared to bet everything he owned, Including his Firebolt,\\nthat it wasn\\'t good news, whatever it was. And sure enough --\\n\\n\"My dear Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at Harry. \"It is here,\\nplainer than ever before... my dear, stalking toward you, growing ever\\ncloser... the Gr --\"\\n\\n\"Oh, for goodness\\' sake!\" said Hermione loudly. \"Not that ridiculous\\nGrim again!\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney raised her enormous eyes to Hermione\\'s face. Parvati\\nwhispered something to Lavender, and they both glared at Hermione too.\\nProfessor Trelawney stood up, surveying Hermione with unmistakable\\nanger.\\n\\n\"I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this class\\nmy dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the noble art of\\nDivination requires. Indeed, I don\\'t remember ever meeting a student\\nwhose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\"\\n\\nThere was a moment\\'s silence. Then --\\n\\n\"Fine!\" said Hermione suddenly, getting up and cramming Unfogging the\\nFuture back into her bag. \"Fine!\" she repeated, swinging the bag over\\nher shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. \"I give up! I\\'m\\nleaving!\"\\n\\nAnd to the whole class\\'s amazement, Hermione strode over to the\\ntrapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of sight.\\n\\nIt took a few minutes for the class to settle down again. Professor\\nTrelawney seemed to have forgotten all about the Grim. She turned\\nabruptly from Harry and Ron\\'s table, breathing rather heavily as she\\ntugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her.\\n\\n\"Ooooo!\" said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \"Ooooo,\\nProfessor Trelawney, I\\'ve just remembered! You saw her leaving, didn\\'t\\nyou? Didn\\'t you, Professor? \\'Around Easter, one of our number will leave\\nus forever!\\' You said it ages ago, Professor!\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be leaving us.\\nOne hopes, however, that one might have mistaken the Signs.... The Inner\\nEye can be a burden, you know...\"\\n\\nLavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over so that\\nProfessor Trelawney could join their table instead.\\n\\n\"Some day Hermione\\'s having, eh?\" Ron muttered to Harry, looking awed.\\n\\n\"Yeah...\"\\n\\nHarry glanced into the crystal ball but saw nothing but swirling white\\nmist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? Would he? The\\nlast thing he needed was another near-fatal accident, with the Quidditch\\nfinal drawing ever nearer.\\n\\nThe Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had never\\nhad so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous\\ncollapse, and he wasn\\'t the only one.\\n\\n\"Call this a holiday!\" Seamus Finnigan roared at the common room one\\nafternoon. \"The exams are ages away, what\\'re they playing at?\"\\n\\nBut nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Divination, she\\nwas taking more subjects than anybody else. She was usually last to\\nleave the common room at night, first to arrive at the library the next\\nmorning; she had shadows like Lupin\\'s under her eyes, and seemed\\nconstantly close to tears.\\n\\nRon had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak\\'s appeal. When he wasn\\'t\\ndoing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with\\nnames like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psychology and Fowl or Foul? A\\nStudy of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so absorbed, he even forgot to be\\nhorrible to Crookshanks.\\n\\nHarry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quidditch practice\\nevery day, not to mention endless discussions of tactics with Wood. The\\nGryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after\\nthe Easter holidays. Slytherin was leading the tournament by exactly two\\nhundred points. This meant (as Wood constantly reminded his team) that\\nthey needed to win the match by more than that amount to win the Cup. It\\nalso meant that the burden of winning fell largely on Harry, because\\ncapturing the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points.\\n\\n\"So you must catch it only if we\\'re more than fifty points up,\" Wood\\ntold Harry constantly. \"Only if we\\'re more than fifty points up, Harry,\\nor we win the match but lose the Cup. You\\'ve got that, Haven\\'t you? You\\nmust catch the Snitch only if we\\'re --\"\\n\\n\"I KNOW, OLIVER!\" Harry yelled.\\n\\nThe whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming match.\\nGryffindor hadn\\'t won the Quidditch Cup since the legendary Charlie\\nWeasley (Ron\\'s second oldest brother) had been seeker. But Harry doubted\\nwhether any of them, even Wood, wanted to win as much as he did. The\\nenmity between Harry and Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy\\nwas still smarting ,bout the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was\\neven more furious that Harry had somehow wormed his way out of\\npunishment. Harry hadn\\'t forgotten Malfoy\\'s attempt to sabotage him in\\nthe match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buckbeak that made\\nhim most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school.\\n\\nNever, in anyone\\'s memory, had a match approached in such a highly\\ncharged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, tension between\\nthe two teams and their Houses was at the breaking point. A number of\\nsmall scuffles broke out in the corridors, culminating in a nasty\\nincident in which a Gryffindor fourth year and a Slytherin sixth year\\nended up in the hospital wing with leeks sprouting out of their ears.\\n\\nHarry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn\\'t walk to\\nclass without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip him\\nup; Crabbe and Goyle kept popping up wherever he went, and slouching\\naway looking disappointed when they saw him surrounded by people. Wood\\nhad given instructions that Harry should be accompanied everywhere he\\nwent, in case the Slytherins tried to put him out of action. The whole\\nof Gryffindor House took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it\\nwas impossible for Harry to get to classes on time because he was\\nsurrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerned for his\\nFirebolt\\'s safety than his own. When he wasn\\'t flying it, he locked it\\nsecurely in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower\\nat break times to check that it was still there.\\n\\nAll usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the\\nnight before the match. Even Hermione had Put down her books.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t work, I can\\'t concentrate,\" she said nervously.\\n\\nThere was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were dealing\\nwith the pressure by being louder and more exuberant than ever. Oliver\\nWood was crouched over a model of a Quidditch field in the corner,\\nprodding little figures across it with his wand and muttering to himself\\nAngelina, Alicia, and Katie were laughing at Fred\\'s and George\\'s jokes.\\nHarry was sitting with Ron and Hermione, removed from the center of\\nthings, trying not to think about the next day, because every time he\\ndid, he had the horrible sensation that something very large was\\nfighting to get out of his stomach.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to be fine,\" Hermione told him, though she looked\\npositively terrified.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got a Firebolt!\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Yeah...\" said Harry, his stomach writhing.\\n\\nIt came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, \"Team! Bed!\"\\n\\nHarry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that Wood\\nwas yelling, \"Where were you? We had to use Neville instead!\" Then he\\ndreamed that Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin team arrived for the\\nmatch riding dragons. He was flying at breakneck speed, trying to avoid\\na spurt of flames from Malfoy\\'s steed\\'s mouth, when he realized he had\\nforgotten his Firebolt. He fell through the air and woke with a start.\\n\\nIt was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match hadn\\'t taken\\nplace yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the Slytherin team\\ndefinitely wouldn\\'t be allowed to play on dragons. He was feeling very\\nthirsty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his four-poster and went to\\npour himself some water from the silver jug beneath the window.\\n\\nThe grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed the\\ntreetops in the Forbidden Forest; the Whomping Willow was motionless and\\ninnocent-looking. It looked as though the conditions for the match would\\nbe perfect.\\n\\nHarry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed when\\nsomething caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across the\\nsilvery lawn.\\n\\nHarry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and put them\\non, then hurried back to the window. It couldn\\'t be the Grim -- not now\\n-- not right before the match -\\n\\nHe peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute\\'s frantic\\nsearching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now... It\\nwasn\\'t the Grim at all ... it was a cat.... Harry clutched the window\\nledge in relief as he recognized the bottlebrush tail. It was only\\nCrookshanks....\\n\\nOr was it only Crookshanks? Harry squinted, pressing his nose flat\\nagainst the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. Harry was\\nsure he could see something else moving in the shadow of the trees too.\\n\\nAnd just then, it emerged -- a gigantic, shaggy black dog, moving\\nstealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. Harry\\nstared. What did this mean? If Crookshanks could see the dog as well,\\nhow could it be an omen of Harry\\'s death?\\n\\n\"Ron!\" Harry hissed. \"Ron! Wake up!\"\\n\\n\"Huh?\"\\n\\nI need you to tell me if you can see something!\"\\n\\n\"S\\'all dark, Harry,\" Ron muttered thickly. \"What\\'re you or, about?\"\\n\\n\"Down here --\"\\n\\nHarry looked quickly back out of the window.\\n\\nCrookshanks and the dog had vanished. Harry climbed onto the windowsill\\nto look right down into the shadows of the castle, but they weren\\'t\\nthere. Where had they gone?\\n\\nA loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again.\\n\\nHarry and the rest of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall the\\nnext day to enormous applause. Harry couldn\\'t help grinning broadly as\\nhe saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were applauding\\nthem too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as they passed. Harry\\nnoticed that Malfoy looked even paler than usual.\\n\\nWood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while touching\\nnothing himself Then he hurried them off to the field before anyone else\\nhad finished, so they could get an idea of the conditions. As they left\\nthe Great Hall, everyone applauded again.\\n\\n\"Good luck, Harry!\" called Cho. Harry felt himself blushing.\\n\\n\"Okay -- no wind to speak of -- sun\\'s a bit bright, that could impair\\nyour vision, watch out for it -- ground\\'s fairly hard, good, that\\'ll\\ngive us a fast kickoff --\"\\n\\nWood paced the field, staring around with the team behind him. Finally,\\nthey saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance and the rest\\nof the school spilling onto the lawn.\\n\\n\"Locker rooms,\" said Wood tersely.\\n\\nNone of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry\\nwondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he\\'d eaten\\nsomething extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed like no time\\nat all, Wood was saying, \"Okay, it\\'s time, let\\'s go --\"\\n\\nThey walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Threequarters\\nof the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet flags with the\\nGryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners with slogans like \"GO\\nGRYFFINDOR!\" and \"LIONS FOR THE CUK\\' Behind the Slytherin goal posts,\\nhowever, two hundred people were wearing green; the silver serpent of\\nSlytherin glittered on their flags, and Professor Snape sat in the very\\nfront row, wearing green like everyone else, and a very grim smile.\\n\\n\"And here are the Gryffindors!\" yelled Lee Jordan, who was acting as\\ncommentator as usual. \"Potter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, Weasley, Weasley,\\nand Wood. Widely acknowledged as the best team Hogwarts has seen in a\\ngood few years --\"\\n\\nLee\\'s comments were drowned by a tide of \"boos\" from the Slytherin end.\\n\\n\"And here come the Slytherin team, led by Captain Flint. He\\'s Made some\\nchanges in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill\\n--\"\\n\\nMore boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought Lee had a\\npoint. Malfoy was easily the smallest person On the Slytherin team; the\\nrest of them were enormous.\\n\\n\"Captains, shake hands!\" said Madam Hooch.\\n\\nFlint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other\\'s hand very\\ntightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other\\'s\\nfingers.\\n\\n\"Mount your brooms!\" said Madam Hooch. \"Three... two... one...\"\\n\\nThe sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as fourteen\\nbrooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead;\\nhis nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw\\nMalfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch.\\n\\n\"And it\\'s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinner of Gryffindor with\\nthe Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, looking\\ngood, Alicia! Argh, no -- Quaffle intercepted by Warrington, Warrington\\nof Slytherin tearing UP the field -- WHAM! -- nice Bludger work there by\\nGeorge Weasley, Warrington drops the Quaffle, it\\'s caught by -- Johnson,\\nGryffindor back in possession, come on, Angelina -- nice swerve around\\nMontague -- duck, Angelina, that\\'s a Bludger!- SHE SCORES! TEN-ZERO TO\\nGRYFFINDOR!\"\\n\\nAngelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the field; the\\nsea of scarlet below was screaming its delight\\n\\n\"OUCH!\"\\n\\nAngelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint went smashing\\ninto her.\\n\\n\"Sorry!\" said Flint as the crowd below booed. \"Sorry, didn\\'t see her!\"\\n\\nA moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater\\'s club at the back of\\nFlint\\'s head. Flint\\'s nose smashed into the handle of his broom and\\nbegan to bleed.\\n\\n\"That will do!\" shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between then. \"Penalty\\nshot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on their Chaser! Penalty\\nshot to Slytherin for deliberate damage to their Chaser!\"\\n\\n\"Come off it, Miss!\" howled Fred, but Madam Hooch blew her whistle and\\nAlicia flew forward to take the penalty.\\n\\n\"Come on, Alicia!\" yelled Lee into the silence that had descended on the\\ncrowd. \"YES! SHE\\'S BEATEN THE KEEPER! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!\"\\n\\nHarry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding freely,\\nfly forward to take the Slytherin penalty. Wood was hovering in front of\\nthe Gryffindor goal posts, his jaw clenched.\\n\\n\"\\'Course, Wood\\'s a superb Keeper!\" Lee Jordan told the crowd as Flint\\nwaited for Madam Hooch\\'s whistle. \"Superb! Very difficult to pass --\\nvery difficult indeed -- YES! I DON\\'T BELIEVE IT! HE\\'S SAVED IT!\"\\n\\nRelieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but still\\nmaking sure he caught every word of Lee\\'s commentary. It was essential\\nthat he hold Malfoy off the Snitch until Gryffindor was more than fifty\\npoints up --\\n\\n\"Gryffindor in possession, no, Slytherin in possession -- no!\\n\\nGryffindor back in possession and it\\'s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for\\nGryffindor with the Quaffle, she\\'s streaking up the field -- THAT WAS\\nDELIBERATE!\"\\n\\nMontague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, and instead\\nof seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cart wheeled in the\\nair, managed to stay on her broom, but dropped the Quaffle.\\n\\nMadam Hooch\\'s whistle rang out again as she soared over to Montague and\\nbegan shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had put another penalty\\npast the Slytherin Seeker.\\n\\n\"THIRTY-ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEATING --\"\\n\\n\"Jordan, if you can\\'t commentate in an unbiased way --\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m telling it like it is, Professor!\"\\n\\nHarry felt a huge jolt of excitement. He had seen the Snitch it was\\nshimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts -- but he\\nmustn\\'t catch it yet -- and if Malfoy saw it -\\n\\nFaking a look of sudden concentration, Harry pulled his Firebolt around\\nand sped off toward the Slytherin end -- it worked. Malfoy went haring\\nafter him, clearly thinking Harry had seen the Snitch there....\\n\\nWHOOSH.\\n\\nOne of the Bludgers came streaking past Harry\\'s right ear, hit by the\\ngigantic Slytherin Beater, Derrick. Then again\\n\\nWHOOSH.\\n\\nThe second Bludger grazed Harry\\'s elbow. The other Beater, Bole, was\\nclosing in.\\n\\nHarry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming toward him,\\nclubs raised --\\n\\nHe turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and Derrick\\ncollided with a sickening crunch.\\n\\n\"Ha haaa!\" yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched away from\\neach other, clutching their heads. \"Too bad, boys! You\\'ll need to get up\\nearlier than that to beat a Firebold And it\\'s Gryffindor in possession\\nagain, as Johnson takes the Quaffle -- Flint alongside her -- poke him\\nin the eye, Angelina! -- it was a joke, Professor, it was a joke -- oh\\nno -- Flint in possession, Flint flying toward the Gryffindor goal\\nposts, come on now, Wood, save --!\"\\n\\nBut Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the Slytherin\\nend, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall tried to tug the\\nmagical megaphone away from him.\\n\\n\"Sorry, Professor, sorry! WoiA happen again! So, Gryffindor in the lead,\\nthirty points to ten, and Gryffindor in possession --\"\\n\\nit was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played in. Enraged\\nthat Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the Slytherins were\\nrapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. Bole hit Alicia with\\nhis club and tried to say he\\'d thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley\\nelbowed Bole in the face in retaliation. Madam Hooch awarded both teams\\npenalties, and Wood pulled off another spectacular save, making the\\nscore forty-ten to Gryffindor.\\n\\nThe Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close to\\nHarry as he soared over the match, looking around for it once Gryffindor\\nwas fifty points ahead -\\n\\nKatie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swooping around\\nher, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were thinking of\\nrevenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred\\'s and George\\'s absence\\nto aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him in the stomach, one after\\nthe other, and he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom,\\ncompletely winded.\\n\\nMadam Hooch was beside herself\\n\\n\"YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING\\nAREA!\" she shrieked at Bole and Derrick. \"Gryffindor penalty!\"\\n\\nAnd Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley pelted a\\nBludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle Out of his hands; Alicia\\nseized it and put it through the Slytherin goal -- seventy-ten.\\n\\nThe Gryffindor crowd below was screaming itself hoarse -- Gryffindor was\\nsixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the Snitch now, the Cup\\nwas theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds of eyes following him as he\\nsoared around the field, high above the rest of the game, with Malfoy\\nspeeding along behind him.\\n\\nAnd then he saw it. The Snitch was sparkling twenty feet above him.\\n\\nHarry put on a huge burst of speed; the wind was roaring in his ears; he\\nstretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slowing down --\\n\\nHorrified, he looked around. Malfoy had thrown himself forward, grabbed\\nhold of the Firebolt\\'s tail, and was pulling it back.\\n\\n\"You --\"\\n\\nHarry was angry enough to hit Malfoy, but couldn\\'t reach -- Malfoy was\\npanting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, but his eyes were\\nsparkling maliciously. He had achieved what he\\'d wanted to do -- the\\nSnitch had disappeared again.\\n\\n\"Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I\\'ve never seen such tactics.\" Madam\\nHooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was sliding back onto his\\nNimbus Two Thousand and One.\\n\\n\"YOU CHEATING SCUM!\" Lee Jordan was howling into the megaphone, dancing\\nout of Professor McGonagall\\'s reach. \"YOU FILTHY, CHEATING B --\"\\n\\nPprofessor McGonagall didn\\'t even bother to tell him off She was\\nactually shaking her finger in Malfoys direction, her hat had fallen\\noff, and she too was shouting furiously.\\n\\nAlicia took Gryffindor\\'s penalty, but she was so angry she missed by\\nseveral feet. The Gryffindor team was losing concentration and the\\nSlytherins, delighted by Malfoy\\'s foul on Harry, were being spurred on\\nto greater heights.\\n\\n\"Slytherin in possession, Slytherin heading for goal -- Montague scores\\n--\" Lee groaned. \"Seventy- twenty to Gryffindor...\"\\n\\nHarry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hitting each\\nother. Harry wasn\\'t going to let Malfoy anywhere near the Snitch....\\n\\n\"Get out of it, Potter!\" Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to\\nturn and found Harry blocking him.\\n\\n\"Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, Angelina,\\nCOME ON!\"\\n\\nHarry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from Malfoy was\\nstreaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the Slytherin Keeper\\n-- they were all going to block her --\\n\\nHarry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat along\\nthe handle, and kicked it forward. Like a bullet, he shot toward the\\nSlytherins.\\n\\n\"AAAAAAARRRGH!\"\\n\\nThey scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina\\'s Way was\\nclear.\\n\\n\"SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty!\"\\n\\nHarry, who had almost pelted headlong into the stands, skidded to a halt\\nin midair, reversed, and zoomed back into the middle of the field.\\n\\nAnd then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy was\\ndiving, a look of triumph on his face -- there, a few feet above the\\ngrass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer -\\n\\nHarry urged the Firebolt downward, but Malfoy was miles ahead -\\n\\n\"Go! Go! Go!\" Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Malfay -- Harry\\nflattened himself to the broom handle as Bole sent a Bludger at him --\\nhe was at Malfoy\\'s ankles -- he was level --\\n\\nHarry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked\\nMalfoy\\'s arm out of the way and --\\n\\n\"YES!\"\\n\\nHe pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium\\nexploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The\\ntiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings\\nhopelessly against his fingers.\\n\\nThen Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized\\nHarry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry\\nfelt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina\\'s,\\nAlicia\\'s, and Katie\\'s voices, \"We\\'ve won the Cup! We\\'ve won the Cup!\"\\nTangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling\\nhoarsely, back to earth.\\n\\nWave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the barriers onto\\nthe field. Hands were raining down on their backs. Harry had a confused\\nimpression of noise and bodies pressing in on him. Then he, and the rest\\nof the team, were hoisted onto the shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into\\nthe light, he saw Hagrid, Plastered with crimson rosettes -- \"Yeh beat\\n\\'em, Harry, yeh beat \\'em!\\n\\nWait till I tell Buckbeak!\" There was Percy, jumping up and down like a\\nmaniac, all dignity forgotten. Professor McGonagall was sobbing harder\\neven than Wood, wiping her eyes with an enormous Gryffindor flag; and\\nthere, fighting their way toward Harry, were Ron and Hermione. Words\\nfailed them. They simply beamed as Harry was borne toward the stands,\\nwhere Dumbledore stood waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup.\\n\\nIf only there had been a dementor around.... As a sobbing Wood passed\\nHarry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have\\nproduced the world\\'s best Patronus.\\n\\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN\\n\\nPROFESSOR TRELAWNEY\\'S PREDICTION\\n\\nHarry\\'s euphoria at finally winning the Quidditch Cup lasted at least a\\nweek. Even the weather seemed to be celebrating; as June approached, the\\ndays became cloudless and sultry, and all anybody felt like doing was\\nstrolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several\\npints of iced pumpkin juice, perhaps playing a casual game of Gobstones\\nor watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of\\nthe lake.\\n\\nBut they couldn\\'t. Exams were nearly upon them, and instead of lazing\\naround outside, the students were forced to remain inside the castle,\\ntrying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of\\nsummer air drifted in through the windows. Even Fred and George Weasley\\nhad been spotted working; they were about to take their O.W.L.s\\n(Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy was getting ready to take his\\nN.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests), the highest\\nqualification Hogwarts offered. As Percy hoped to enter the Ministry of\\nMagic, he needed top grades. He was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave\\nvery severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common\\nroom in the evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious\\nthan Percy was Hermione.\\n\\nHarry and Ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend\\nseveral classes at once, but they couldn\\'t restrain themselves when they\\nsaw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself. The first column\\nread:\\n\\nMonday\\n\\n9 o\\'clock, Arithmancy\\n\\n9 o\\'clock, Transfiguration\\n\\nLunch\\n\\n1 o\\'clock, Charms\\n\\n1 o\\'clock, Ancient Runes\\n\\n\"Hermione?\" Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when\\ninterrupted these days. \"Er -- are you sure you\\'ve copied down these\\ntimes right?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and examining it.\\n\"Yes, of course I have.\"\\n\\n\"Is there any point asking how you\\'re going to sit for two exams at\\nonce?\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Hermione shortly. \"Have either of you seen my copy of\\nNumerology and Gramatica?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,\" said Ron, but\\nvery quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment Harry, Ron,\\nand Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to Hagrid.\\n\\n\"Beaky\\'s gettin\\' a bit depressed,\" Hagrid told them, bending low on the\\npretense of checking that Harry\\'s flobberworm was still alive. \"Bin\\ncooped up too long. But still... we\\'ll know day after tomorrow -- one\\nway or the other --\"\\n\\nThey had Potions that afternoon, which was an unqualified disaster. Try\\nas Harry might, he couldn\\'t get his Confusing Concoction to thicken, and\\nSnape, standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure, scribbled\\nsomething that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before\\nmoving away.\\n\\nThen came Astronomy at midnight, up on the tallest tower; History of\\nMagic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry scribbled everything Florean\\nFortescue had ever told him about medieval witch-hunts, while wishing he\\ncould have had one of Fortescue\\'s choco-nut sundaes with him in the\\nstifling classroom. Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the\\ngreenhouses under a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once\\nmore, with sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day,\\nwhen it would all be over.\\n\\nTheir second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense Against the\\nDark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of\\nthem had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun, where\\nthey had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow,\\ncross a series of potholes full of Red Caps, squish their way across a\\npatch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk,\\nthen climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart.\\n\\n\"Excellent, Harry,\" Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the trunk,\\ngrinning. \"Full marks.\"\\n\\nFlushed with his success, Harry hung around to watch Ron and Hermione.\\nRon did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, which successfully\\nconfused him into sinking waist-high into the quagmire. Hermione did\\neverything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it.\\nAfter about a minute inside it, she burst out again, screaming.\\n\\n\"Hermione!\" said Lupin, startled. \"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\\n\"P -- P -- Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione gasped, pointing into the\\ntrunk. \"Sh -- she said I\\'d failed everything!\"\\n\\nIt took a little while to calm Hermione down. When at last she had\\nregained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to the castle.\\nRon was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione\\'s boggart, but an\\nargument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps.\\n\\nCornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was standing\\nthere staring out at the grounds. He started at the sight of Harry.\\n\\n\"Hello there, Harry!\" he said. \"Just had an exam, I expect? Nearly\\nfinished?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not being on speaking terms with\\nthe Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardly in the background.\\n\\n\"Lovely day,\" said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake.\\n\\n\"Pity... pity...\"\\n\\nHe sighed deeply and looked down at Harry.\\n\\n\"I\\'m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the\\nDisposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a\\nmad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black\\nsituation, I was asked to step in.\"\\n\\n\"Does that mean the appeal\\'s already happened?\" Ron interrupted,\\nstepping forward.\\n\\n\"No, no, it\\'s scheduled for this afternoon,\" said Fudge, looking\\ncuriously at Ron.\\n\\n\"Then you might not have to witness an execution at A!\" said Eon\\nstoutly. \"The hippogriff might get off!\"\\n\\nBefore Fudge could answer, two wizards came through the castle doors\\nbehind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their\\nvery eyes; the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache.\\nHarry gathered that they were representatives of the Committee for the\\nDisposal of Dangerous Creatures, because tie very old wizard squinted\\ntoward Hagrid\\'s cabin and said in a feeble voice, \"Dear, dear, I\\'m\\ngetting too old for this.... Two o\\'clock, isn\\'t it, Fudge?\"\\n\\nThe black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; Harry\\nlooked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a\\nshining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say something, but Hermione nudged\\nhim hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall.\\n\\n\"Why\\'d you stop me?\" said Ron angrily as they entered the Great Hall for\\nlunch. \"Did you see them? They\\'ve even got the axe ready! This isn\\'t\\njustice!\"\\n\\n\"Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can\\'t go saying things like\\nthat to his boss!\" said Hermione, but she too looked very upset. \"As\\nlong as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argue, hi case properly,\\nthey can\\'t possibly execute Buckbeak....\"\\n\\nBut Harry could tell Hermione didn\\'t really believe what she was saying.\\nAll around them, people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch,\\nhappily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon, but Harry,\\nRon, and Hermione, lost in worry about Hagrid and Buckbeak, didn\\'t join\\nin.\\n\\nHarry\\'s and Ron\\'s last exam was Divination; Hermione\\'s, Muggle Studies.\\nThey walked up the marble staircase together; Hermione left them on the\\nfirst floor and Harry and Ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh,\\nwhere many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to\\nProfessor Trelawney\\'s classroom, trying to cram in a bit of last-minute\\nstudying.\\n\\n\"She\\'s seeing us all separately,\" Neville informed them as they went to\\nsit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Future open on\\nhis lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing. \"Have either of you ever\\nseen anything in a crystal ball?\" he asked them unhappily.\\n\\n\"Nope,\" said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his watch; Harry.\\nknew that he was counting down the time until Buckbeak\\'s appeal started.\\n\\nThe line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly. As each\\nperson climbed back down the silver ladder, the rest of the class\\nhissed, \"What did she ask? Was it okay?\"\\n\\nBut they all refused to say.\\n\\n\"She says the crystal ball\\'s told her that if I tell you, I\\'ll have a\\nhorrible accident!\" squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the\\nladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing.\\n\\n\"That\\'s convenient,\" snorted Ron. \"You know, I\\'m starting to think\\nHermione was right about her\" -- he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor\\noverhead -- \"she\\'s a right old fraud.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" said Harry, looking at his own watch. It-was now two o\\'clock.\\n\"Wish she\\'d hurry up...\"\\n\\nParvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride.\\n\\n\"She says I\\'ve got all the makings of a true Seer,\" she informed Harry\\nand Ron. \"I saw loads of stuff... Well, good luck!\"\\n\\nShe hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender.\\n\\n\"Ronald Weasley,\" said the familiar, misty voice from over their heads.\\nRon grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry\\nwas now the only person left to be tested. He settled himself on the\\nfloor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly buzzing in the\\nsunny window, his mind across the grounds with Hagrid.\\n\\nFinally, after about twenty minutes, Ron\\'s large feet reappeared on the\\nladder.\\n\\n\"How\\'d it go?\" Harry asked him, standing up.\\n\\n\"Rubbish,\" said Ron. \"Couldn\\'t see a thing, so I made some stuff up.\\nDon\\'t think she was convinced, though....\"\\n\\n\"Meet you in the common room,\" Harry muttered as Professor Trelawney\\'s\\nvoice called, \"Harry Potter!\"\\n\\nThe tower room was hotter than ever before; the curtains were closed,\\nthe fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he\\nstumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where Professor\\nTrelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball.\\n\\n\"Good day, my dear,\" she said softly. \"If you would kindly gaze into the\\nOrb.... Take your time, now... then tell me what you see within it....\"\\n\\nHarry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could,\\nwilling it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but\\nnothing happened.\\n\\n\"Well?\" Professor Trelawney prompted delicately. \"What do you see?\"\\n\\nThe heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the\\nperfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He thought of what Ron\\nhad just said, and decided to pretend.\\n\\n\"Er --\" said Harry, \"a dark shape... um...\"\\n\\n\"What does it resemble?\" whispered Professor Trelawney. \"Think, now...\"\\n\\nHarry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak.\\n\\n\"A hippogriff,\" he said firmly.\\n\\n\"Indeed!\" whispered Professor Trelawney, scribbling keenly on the\\nparchment perched upon her knees. \"My boy, you may well be seeing the\\noutcome of poor Hagrid\\'s trouble with the Ministry of Magic! Look\\ncloser... Does the hippogriff appear to... have its head?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Harry firmly.\\n\\n\"Are you sure?\" Professor Trelawney urged him. \"Are you quite sure,\\ndear? You don\\'t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy\\nfigure raising an axe behind it?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick.\\n\\n\"No blood? No weeping Hagrid?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the\\nheat. \"It looks fine, it\\'s - - flying away...\"\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney sighed.\\n\\n\"Well, dear, I think we\\'ll leave it there.... A little disappointing...\\nbut I\\'m sure you did your best.\"\\n\\nRelieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but then a\\nloud, harsh voice spoke behind him.\\n\\n\"IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT.\"\\n\\nHarry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in her\\narmchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.\\n\\n\"S -- sorry?\" said Harry.\\n\\nBut Professor Trelawney didn\\'t seem to hear him. Her eyes started to\\nroll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she was about to\\nhave some sort of seizure. He hesitated, thinking of running to the\\nhospital wing -- and then Professor Trelawney spoke again, in the same\\nharsh voice, quite unlike her own:\\n\\n\"THE DARK LORD LIES ALONE AND FRIENDLESS, ABANDONED BY HIS FOLLOWERS.\\nHIS SERVANT HAS BEEN CHAINED THESE TWELVE YEARS. TONIGHT, BEFORE\\nMIDNIGHT... THE SERVANT WILL BREAK FREE AND SET OUT TO REJOIN HIS\\nMASTER. THE DARK LORD WILL RISE AGAIN WITH HIS SERVANTS AID, GREATER AND\\nMORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER HE WAS. TONIGHT... BEFORE MIDNIGHT... THE\\nSERVANT... WILL SET OU... TO REJOIN... HIS MASTER....\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney\\'s head fell forward onto her chest. She made a\\ngrunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite\\nsuddenly, Professor Trelawney\\'s head snapped up again.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so sorry, dear boy,\" she said dreamily, \"the heat of the day, you\\nknow... I drifted off for a moment....\"\\n\\nHarry sat there, staring at her.\\n\\n\"Is there anything wrong, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"You -- you just told me that the -- the Dark Lord\\'s going to rise\\nagain... that his servant\\'s going to go back to him.\\n\\nProfessor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled.\\n\\n\"The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, that\\'s hardly\\nsomething to joke about.... Rise again, indeed --\"\\n\\n,\\'But you just said it! You. said the Dark Lord --\"\\n\\n\"I think you must have dozed off too, dear!\" said Professor Trelawney.\\n\"I would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as far-fetched\\nas that!\"\\n\\nHarry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase,\\nwondering... had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real\\nprediction? Or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test?\\n\\nFive minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the\\nentrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney\\'s words still\\nresounding in his head. People were striding past him in the opposite\\ndirection, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a bit of\\nlong-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the portrait hole and\\nentered the common room, it was almost deserted. Over in the corner,\\nhowever, sat Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n\"Professor Trelawney,\" Harry panted, \"just told me --\"\\n\\nBut he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces.\\n\\n\"Buckbeak lost,\" said Ron weakly. \"Hagrid\\'s just sent this.\"\\n\\nHagrid\\'s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his\\nhand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly\\nlegible.\\n\\nLost appeal. They\\'re going to execute at sunset. Nothing you can do.\\nDon\\'t come down. I don\\'t want you to see it.\\n\\nHagrid\\n\\n\"We\\'ve got to go,\" said Harry at once. \"He can\\'t just sit there on his\\nown, waiting for the executioner!\"\\n\\n\"Sunset, though,\" said Ron, who was staring out the window ill a glazed\\nsort of way. \"We\\'d never be allowed... \\'specially you, Harry....\"\\n\\nHarry sank his head into his hands, thinking.\\n\\n\"If we only had the Invisibility Cloak....\"\\n\\n\"Where is it?\" said Hermione.\\n\\nHarry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed\\nwitch.\\n\\n\"... if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I\\'m in serious\\ntrouble,\" he finished.\\n\\n\"That\\'s true,\" said Hermione, getting to her feet. \"If he sees you....\\nHow do you open the witch\\'s hump again?\"\\n\\n\"You -- you tap it and say, \\'Dissendium,\\'\" said Harry. \"But --\"\\n\\nHermione didn\\'t wait for the rest of his sentence; she strode across the\\nroom, pushed open the Fat Lady\\'s portrait and vanished from sight.\\n\\n\"She hasn\\'t gone to get it?\" Ron said, staring after her.\\n\\nShe had. Hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery\\ncloak folded carefully under her robes.\\n\\n\"Hermione, I don\\'t know what\\'s gotten, into you lately!\" said Ron,\\nastounded. \"First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Professor\\nTrelawney --\"\\n\\nHermione looked rather flattered.\\n\\nThey went down to dinner with everybody else, but did not return to\\nGryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down tie front of\\nhis robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump. They skulked\\nin an empty chamber off the entrance hall, listening, until they were\\nsure it was deserted. They heard a last pair of people hurrying across\\nthe hall and a door slamming. Hermione poked her head around the door.\\n\\n\"Okay,\" she whispered, \"no one there -- cloak on --\"\\n\\nWalking very close together so that nobody would see them, they crossed\\nthe hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak, then walked down the stone front\\nsteps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking behind the Forbidden\\nForest, gilding the top branches of the trees.\\n\\nThey reached Hagrid\\'s cabin and knocked. He was a minute in answering,\\nand when he did, he looked all around for his visitor, pale-faced and\\ntrembling.\\n\\n\"It\\'s us,\" Harry hissed. \"We\\'re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us\\nin and we can take it off.\"\\n\\n\"Yeh shouldn\\'ve come!\" Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, and they\\nstepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry pulled off the\\ncloak.\\n\\nHagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their necks. He\\nlooked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This\\nhelplessness was worse to watch than tears.\\n\\n\"Wan\\' some tea?\" he said. His great hands were shaking as he reached for\\nthe kettle.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Buckbeak, Hagrid?\" said Hermione hesitantly.\\n\\nI -- I took him outside,\" said Hagrid, spilling milk all over the table\\nas he filled up the jug. \"He\\'s tethered in me pumpkin patch. Thought he\\noughta see the trees an\\' -- an\\' smell fresh air -- before\\n\\nHagrid\\'s hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his\\ngrasp and shattered all over the floor.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do it, Hagrid,\" said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and starting\\nto clean up the mess.\\n\\n\"There\\'s another one in the cupboard,\" Hagrid said, sitting down and\\nwiping his forehead on his sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, who looked back\\nhopelessly.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?\" Harry asked fiercely,\\nsitting down next to him. \"Dumbledore --\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s tried,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\'s got no power ter overrule the\\nCommittee. He told \\'em Buckbeak\\'s all right, but they\\'re scared.... Yeh\\nknow what Lucius Malfoy\\'s like... threatened \\'em, I expect... an\\' the\\nexecutioner, Macnair, he\\'s an old pal o\\' Malfoy\\'s... but it\\'ll be quick\\nan\\' clean... an\\' I\\'ll be beside him.... \"\\n\\nHagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as though\\nlooking for some shred of hope or comfort.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore\\'s gonna come down while it -- while it happens. Wrote me\\nthis mornin\\'. Said he wants ter -- ter be with me. Great man,\\nDumbledore....\"\\n\\nHermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid\\'s cupboard for another milk\\njug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straightened up with the\\nnew jug in her hands, fighting back tears.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll stay with you too, Hagrid,\" she began, but Hagrid shook his\\nshaggy head.\\n\\n\"Yeh\\'re ter go back up ter the castle. I told yeh, I don\\' wan\\' yeh\\nwatchin\\'. An\\' yeh shouldn\\' be down here anyway... If Fudge an\\'\\nDumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh\\'ll be in big\\ntrouble.\"\\n\\nSilent tears were now streaming down Hermione\\'s face, but she hid them\\nfrom Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she picked up the milk\\nbottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a shriek.\\n\\n\"Ron, I don\\'t believe it -- it\\'s Scabbers!\"\\n\\nRon gaped at her.\\n\\n\"What are you talking about?\"\\n\\nHermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside\\ndown. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get back inside,\\nScabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table.\\n\\n\"Scabbers!\" said Ron blankly. \"Scabbers, what are you doing here?\"\\n\\nHe grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. Scabbers\\nlooked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of hair had\\nfallen out leaving wide bald patches, and he writhed in Ron\\'s hands as\\nthough desperate to free himself\\n\\n\"It\\'s okay, Scabbers!\" said Ron. \"No cats! There\\'s nothing here to hurt\\nyou!\"\\n\\nHagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His normally\\nruddy face had gone the color of parchment.\\n\\n\"They\\'re comin\\'....\"\\n\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men was walking down\\nthe distant castle steps. In front was Albus Dumbledore, his silver\\nbeard gleaming in the dying sun. Next to him trotted Cornelius Fudge.\\nBehind them came the feeble old Committee member and the executioner,\\nMacnair.\\n\\n\"Yeh gotta go,\" said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. \"They\\nmustn\\' find yeh here.... Go now...\"\\n\\nRon stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up the cloak.\\n\"I\\'ll let yeh out the back way,\" said Hagrid.\\n\\nThey followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt strangely\\nunreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few yards away, tethered\\nto a tree behind Hagrid\\'s Pumpkin patch. Buckbeak seemed to know\\nsomething was happening. He turned his sharp head from side to side and\\npawed the ground nervously.\\n\\n\"It\\'s okay, Beaky,\" said Hagrid softly. \"It\\'s okay...\" He turned to\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on,\" he said. \"Get goin\\'.\"\\n\\nBut they didn\\'t move.\\n\\n\"Hagrid, we can\\'t --\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll tell them what really happened --\"\\n\\n\"They can\\'t kill him --\"\\n\\n\"Go!\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"It\\'s bad enough without you lot in trouble\\nan\\' all!\"\\n\\nThey had no choice. As Hermione threw the cloak over Harry and Ron, they\\nheard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked at the place where\\nthey had just vanished from sight.\\n\\n\"Go quick,\" he said hoarsely. \"Don\\' listen....\"\\n\\nAnd he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door.\\n\\nSlowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off\\nsilently around Hagrid\\'s house. As they reached the other side, the\\nfront door closed with a sharp snap.\\n\\n\"Please, let\\'s hurry,\" Hermione whispered. \"I can\\'t stand it, I can\\'t\\nbear it....\"\\n\\nThey started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was sinking\\nfast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, but to the\\nwest there was a ruby-red glow.\\n\\nRon stopped dead.\\n\\n\"Oh, please, Ron,\" Hermione began.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Scabbers -- he won\\'t -- stay put --\"\\n\\nRon was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the rat\\nwas going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, trying to\\nsink his teeth into Ron\\'s hand.\\n\\n\"Scabbers, it\\'s me, you idiot, it\\'s Ron,\" Ron hissed.\\n\\nThey heard a door open behind them and men\\'s voices.\\n\\n\"Oh, Ron, please let\\'s move, they\\'re going to do it!\" Hermione breathed.\\n\\n\"Okay -- Scabbers, stay put --\"\\n\\nThey walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to listen to\\nthe rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t hold him -- Scabbers, shut up, everyone\\'ll hear us --\"\\n\\nThe rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up the\\nsounds drifting from Hagrid\\'s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct\\nmale voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable\\nswish and thud of an axe.\\n\\nHermione swayed on the spot.\\n\\n\"They did it!\" she whispered to Harry. \"I d -- don\\'t believe it -- they\\ndid it!\"\\n\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\n\\nCAT, RAT, AND DOG\\n\\nHarry\\'s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood\\ntransfixed with horror under the Invisibility Cloak. The very last rays\\nof the setting sun were casting a bloody light over the long- shadowed\\ngrounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild howling.\\n\\n\"Hagrid,\" Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he was doing, he\\nmade to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione seized his arms.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t,\" said Ron, who was paper-white. \"He\\'ll be in worse trouble if\\nthey know we\\'ve been to see him....\"\\n\\nHermione\\'s breathing was shallow and uneven.\\n\\n\"How -- could -- they?\" she choked. \"How could they?\"\\n\\n\"Come on,\" said Ron, whose teeth seemed to be chattering.\\n\\nThey set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep themselves\\nhidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now.\\n\\nBy the time they reached open ground, darkness was settling like a spell\\naround them.\\n\\n\"Scabbers, keep still,\" Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his chest.\\nThe rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, trying to force\\nScabbers deeper into his pocket. \"What\\'s the matter with you, You stupid\\nrat? Stay still -- OUCH! He bit me!\"\\n\\n\"Ron, be quiet!\" Hermione whispered urgently. \"Fudge\\'ll be out here in a\\nminute --\"\\n\\n\"He won\\'t -- stay -- put --\"\\n\\nScabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his might,\\ntrying to break free of Ron\\'s grip.\\n\\n\"What\\'s the matter with him?\"\\n\\nBut Harry had just seen -- stinking toward them, his body low to the\\nground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness -- Crookshanks.\\nWhether he could see them or was following the sound of Scabbers\\'s\\nsqueaks, Harry couldn\\'t tell.\\n\\n\"Crookshanks!\" Hermione moaned. \"No, go away, Crookshanks! Go away!\"\\n\\nBut the cat was getting nearer --\\n\\n\"Scabbers -- NO!\"\\n\\nToo late -- the rat had slipped between Ron\\'s clutching fingers, hit the\\nground, and scampered away. In one bound, Crookshanks sprang after him,\\nand before Harry or Hermione could stop him, Ron had thrown the\\nInvisibility Cloak off himself and pelted away into the darkness.\\n\\n\"Ron!\" Hermione moaned.\\n\\nShe and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it \"\"as\\nimpossible to run full out under the cloak; they pulled it off and it\\nstreamed behind them like a banner as they hurtled after Ron; they could\\nhear his feet thundering along ahead and his shouts at Crookshanks.\\n\\n\"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\\n\\nThere was a loud thud.\\n\\n\"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a stop right in\\nfront of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but Scabbers was back in\\nhis pocket; he had both hands held tight over the quivering lump.\\n\\n\"Ron -- come on back under the cloak --\" Hermione panted. \"Dumbledore\\nthe Minister -- they\\'ll be coming back out in a minute --\"\\n\\nBut before they could cover themselves again, before they could even\\ncatch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic paws....\\nSomething was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow -- an enormous,\\npale-eyed, jet-black dog.\\n\\nHarry reached for his wand, but too late -- the dog had made an enormous\\nleap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he keeled over backward in\\na whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw inch- long teeth -\\n\\nBut the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him.\\nDazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up;\\nhe could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack.\\n\\nRon was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he pushed Harry\\naside; the dog\\'s jaws fastened instead around Ron\\'s outstretched arm.\\nHarry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute\\'s hair, but it\\nwas dragging Ron away as easily as though he were a rag doll --\\n\\nThen, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the face he was\\nknocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek with pain and fall\\ntoo.\\n\\nHarry groped for his wand, blinking blood out of his eyes\\n\\n\"Lumos!\"he whispered.\\n\\nThe wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had chased\\nScabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its branches were\\ncreaking as though in a high wind, whipping backward and forward to stop\\nthem going nearer.\\n\\nAnd there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron backward\\ninto a large gap in the roots -- Ron was fighting furiously, but his\\nhead and torso were slipping out of sight --\\n\\n\"Ron!\" Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch whipped\\nlethally through the air and he was forced backward again.\\n\\nAll they could see now was one of Ron\\'s legs, which he had hooked around\\na root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground\\n-- but a horrible crack cut the air like a gunshot; Ron\\'s leg had\\nbroken, and a moment later, his foot vanished from sight.\\n\\n\"Harry -- we\\'ve got to go for help --\" Hermione gasped; she was bleeding\\ntoo; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder.\\n\\n\"No! That thing\\'s big enough to eat him; we haven\\'t got time --\"\\n\\n\"Harry -- we\\'re never going to get through without help --\"\\n\\nAnother branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like knuckles.\\n\\n\"If that dog can get in, we can,\" Harry panted, darting here and there,\\ntrying to find a way through the vicious, swishing branches, but he\\ncouldn\\'t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in range of\\nthe tree\\'s blows.\\n\\n\"Oh, help, help,\" Hermione whispered frantically, dancing U._ certainly\\non the spot, \"Please...\"\\n\\nCrookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering branches\\nlike a snake and placed his front paws upon a knot on the trunk.\\n\\nAbruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it stopped\\nmoving. Not a leaf twitched or shook.\\n\\n\"Crookshanks!\" Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now grasped Harry\\'s\\narm painfully hard. \"How did he know --?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s friends with that dog,\" said Harry grimly. \"I\\'ve seen them\\ntogether. Come on -- and keep your wand out --\"\\n\\nThey covered the distance to the trunk in seconds, but before they had\\nreached the gap in the roots, Crookshanks had slid into it with a flick\\nof his bottlebrush tail. Harry went next; he crawled forward, headfirst,\\nand slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a very low tunnel.\\nCrookshanks was a little way along, his eyes flashing in the light from\\nHarry\\'s wand. Seconds later, Hermione slithered down beside him.\\n\\n\"Where\\'s Ron?\" she whispered in a terrified voice.\\n\\n\"This way,\" said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crookshanks.\\n\\n\"Where does this tunnel come out?\" Hermione asked breathlessly from\\nbehind him.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know... It\\'s marked on the Marauder\\'s Map but Fred and George\\nsaid no one\\'s ever gotten into it.... It goes off the edge of the map,\\nbut it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade...\"\\n\\nThey moved as fast as they could, bent almost double; ahead of them,\\nCrookshanks\\'s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on went the\\npassage; it felt at least as long as the one to Honeydukes.... All Harry\\ncould think of was Ron and what the enormous dog might be doing to\\nhim.... He was drawing breath in sharp, painful gasps, running at a\\ncrouch....\\n\\nAnd then the tunnel began to rise; moments later it twisted, and\\nCrookshanks had gone. instead, Harry could see a patch of dim light\\nthrough a small opening.\\n\\nHe and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. Both raised\\ntheir wands to see what lay beyond.\\n\\nIt was a room, a very disordered, dusty room. Paper was peeling from the\\nwalls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture\\nwas broken as though somebody had smashed it. The windows were all\\nboarded up.\\n\\nHarry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but nodded.\\n\\nHarry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room was\\ndeserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a shadowy\\nhallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry\\'s arm again. Her wide eyes were\\ntraveling around the boarded windows.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" she whispered, \"I think we\\'re in the Shrieking Shack.\"\\n\\nHarry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near them. Large\\nchunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had been ripped off\\nentirely.\\n\\n\"Ghosts didn\\'t do that,\" he said slowly.\\n\\nAt that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had Moved\\nupstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione\\'s grip on\\nHarry\\'s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in-his fingers. He raised\\nhis eyebrows at her; she nodded again and let go.\\n\\nQuietly as they could, they crept out into the hall and UP the crumbling\\nstaircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust except the\\nfloor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by something being\\ndragged upstairs.\\n\\nThey reached the dark landing.\\n\\n\"Nox,\" they whispered together, and the lights at the end of their wands\\nwent out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, they heard\\nmovement from behind it; a low moan, and then a deep, loud purring. They\\nexchanged a last look, a last nod.\\n\\nWand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide open.\\n\\nOn a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay Crookshanks,\\npurring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor beside him, clutching\\nhis leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was Ron.\\n\\nHarry and Hermione dashed across to him.\\n\\n\"Ron -- are you okay?\"\\n\\n\"Where\\'s the dog?\"\\n\\n\"Not a dog,\" Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. \"Harry, it\\'s\\na trap --\"\\n\\n\"What --\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s the dog... he\\'s an Animagus.\"\\n\\nRon was staring over Harry\\'s shoulder. Harry wheeled around. With a\\nsnap, the man in the shadows closed the door behind them.\\n\\nA mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn\\'t been\\nshining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a corpse. The\\nwaxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his face, it looked\\nlike a skull. His yellow teeth were bared in a grin. It was Sirius\\nBlack.\\n\\n\"Expelliarmus!\"he croaked, pointing Ron\\'s wand at them.\\n\\nHarry\\'s and Hermione\\'s wands shot out of their hands, high in the air,\\nand Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes were fixed\\non Harry.\\n\\n\"I thought you\\'d come and help your friend,\" he said hoarsely.\\n\\nHis voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of using\\nit. \"Your father would have done the same for me. Brave of you) not to\\nrun for a teacher. I\\'m grateful... it will make everything much\\neasier....\"\\n\\nThe taunt about his father rang in Harry\\'s ears as though Black had\\nbellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry\\'s chest, leaving no place\\nfor fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back in his\\nhand, not to defend himself, but to attack... to kill. Without knowing\\nwhat he was doing, he started forward, but there was a sudden movement\\non either side of him and two pairs of hands grabbed him and held him\\nback.... \"No, Harry!\" Hermione gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron,\\nhowever, spoke to Black.\\n\\n\"If you want to kill Harry, you\\'ll have to kill us too!\" he said\\nfiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of\\nstill more color, and he swayed slightly as he spoke.\\n\\nSomething flickered in Black\\'s shadowed eyes.\\n\\n\"Lie down,\" he said quietly to Ron. \"You will damage that leg even\\nmore.\"\\n\\n\"Did you hear me?\" Ron said weakly, though he was clinging painfully to\\nHarry to stay upright. \"You\\'ll have to kill all three of us!\"\\n\\n\"There\\'ll be only one murder here tonight,\" said Brack, and his grin\\nwidened.\\n\\n\"Why\\'s that?\" Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron, and\\nHermione. \"Didn\\'t care last time, did you? Didn\\'t mind slaughtering all\\nthose Muggles to get at Pettigrew... What\\'s the matter, gone soft in\\nAzkaban?\"\\n\\n\"Harry!\" Hermione whimpered. \"Be quiet!\"\\n\\n\"HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD!\" Harry roared, and with a huge effort he\\nbroke free of Hermione\\'s and Ron\\'s restraint and lunged forward -\\n\\nHe had forgotten about magic -- he had forgotten that he was short and\\nskinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown man -- all\\nHarry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly as he could and\\nthat he didn\\'t care how much he got hurt in return --\\n\\nPerhaps it was the shock of Harry doing something so stupid, but Black\\ndidn\\'t raise the wands in time -- one of Harry\\'s hands fastened over his\\nwasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the knuckles of Harry\\'s other\\nhand collided with the side of Black\\'s head and they fell, backward,\\ninto the wall -\\n\\nHermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding flash as\\nthe wands in Black\\'s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed\\nHarry\\'s face by inches; Harry felt the shrunken arm under his fingers\\ntwisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand punching every part of\\nBlack it could find.\\n\\nBut Black\\'s free hand had found Harry\\'s throat\\n\\n\"No,\" he hissed, \"I\\'ve waited too long --\"\\n\\nThe fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew.\\n\\nThen he saw Hermione\\'s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go of Harry\\nwith a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black\\'s wand hand and\\nHarry heard a faint clatter --\\n\\nHe fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand rolling\\nacross the floor; he threw himself toward it but\\n\\n\"Argh!\"\\n\\nCrookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had sunk\\nthemselves deep into Harry\\'s arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks\\nnow darted toward Harry\\'s wand --\\n\\n\"NO YOU DON\\'T!\" roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at Crookshanks that\\nmade the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched up his wand and turned\\n-\\n\\n\"Get out of the way!\" he shouted at Ron and Hermione.\\n\\nThey didn\\'t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, her lip\\nbleeding, scrambled aside, snatching up her and Ron\\'s wands. Ron crawled\\nto the four-poster and collapsed onto it, panting, his white face now\\ntinged with green, both hands clutching his broken leg.\\n\\nBlack was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose and\\nfell rapidly as he watched Harry walking slowly nearer, his wand\\npointing straight at Black\\'s heart.\\n\\n\"Going to kill me, Harry?\" he whispered.\\n\\nHarry stopped right above him, his wand still pointing at Black\\'s chest,\\nlooking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around Black\\'s left eye\\nand his nose was bleeding.\\n\\n\"You killed my parents,\" said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, but his\\nwand hand quite steady.\\n\\nBlack stared up at him out of those sunken eyes.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t deny it,\" he said very quietly. \"But if you knew the whole\\nstory.\"\\n\\n\"The whole story?\" Harry repeated, a furious pounding in his ears. \"You\\nsold them to Voldemort. That\\'s all I need to know.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ve got to listen to me,\" Black said, and there was a note of\\nurgency in his voice now. \"You\\'ll regret it if you don\\'t.... You don\\'t\\nunderstand....\"\\n\\n\"I understand a lot better than you think,\" said Harry, and his voice\\nshook more than ever. \"You never heard her, did you? My mum... trying to\\nstop Voldemort killing me... and you did that... you did it....\"\\n\\nBefore either of them could say another word, something ginger streaked\\npast Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black\\'s chest and settled himself\\nthere, right over Black\\'s heart. Black blinked and looked down at the\\ncat.\\n\\n\"Get off,\" he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him.\\n\\nBut Crookshanks sank his claws into Black\\'s robes and wouldn\\'t shift. He\\nturned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at him with those\\ngreat yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry sob.\\n\\nHarry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tightening on the\\nwand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in league with\\nBlack.... If it was prepared to die, trying to protect Black, that\\nwasn\\'t Harry\\'s business.... If Black wanted to save it, that only proved\\nhe cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry\\'s parents....\\n\\nHarry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was the moment\\nto avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill Black. He had to\\nkill Black. This was his chance....\\n\\nThe seconds lengthened. And still Harry stood frozen there, wand poised,\\nBlack staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. Ron\\'s ragged\\nbreathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite silent.\\n\\nAnd then came a new sound -\\n\\nMuffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor -- someone was\\nmoving downstairs.\\n\\n\"WE\\'RE UP HERE!\" Hermione screamed suddenly. \"WE\\'RE UP HERE -- SIRIUS\\nBLACK - QUICK!\"\\n\\nBlack made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crookshanks; Harry\\ngripped his wand convulsively -- Do it now! said a voice in his head --\\nbut the footsteps were thundering up the stairs and Harry still hadn\\'t\\ndone it.\\n\\nThe door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and Harry\\nwheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the room, his face\\nbloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flickered over Ron, lying\\non the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to the door, to Harry,\\nstanding there with his wand covering Black, and then to Black himself,\\ncrumpled and bleeding at Harry\\'s feet.\\n\\n\"Expelliarmus!\" Lupin shouted.\\n\\nHarry\\'s wand flew once more out of his hand; so did the two Hermione was\\nholding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring\\nat Black, who still had Crookshanks lying Protectively across his chest.\\n\\nHarry stood there, feeling suddenly empty. He hadn\\'t done it. His nerve\\nhad failed him. Black was going to be handed back to the dementors.\\n\\nThen Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice.\\n\\n\"Where is he, Sirius?\"\\n\\nHarry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn\\'t understannd what Lupin meant.\\nWho was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at Black again.\\n\\nBlack\\'s face was quite expressionless. For a few seconds, he didn\\'t move\\nat all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and pointed straight\\nat Ron. Mystified, Harry glanced around at Ron, who looked bewildered.\\n\\n\"But then...\" Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it seemed he\\nwas trying to read his mind, \"... why hasn\\'t he shown himself before\\nnow? Unless\" -- Lupin\\'s eyes suddenly widened, as though he was seeing\\nsomething beyond Black, something none of the rest could see, \"-- unless\\nhe was the one... unless you switched... without telling me?\"\\n\\nVery slowly, his sunken gaze never leaving Lupin\\'s face, Black nodded.\\n\\n\"Professor,\" Harry interrupted loudly, \"what\\'s going on --?\"\\n\\nBut he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice\\ndie in his throat. Lupin was lowering his wand, gazing fixed at Black.\\nThe Professor walked to Black\\'s side, seized his hand, pulled him to his\\nfeet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, and embraced Black like a\\nbrother.\\n\\nHarry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach.\\n\\n\"DON\\'T BELIEVE IT!\" Hermione screamed.\\n\\nLupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself off the\\nfloor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. \"You -- you --\"\\n\\n\"Hermione --\"\\n\\n\"-- you and him!\"\\n\\n\"Hermione, calm down --\"\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t tell anyone!\" Hermione shrieked. \"I\\'ve been covering up for\\nyou --\"\\n\\n\"Hermione, listen to me, please\\'\" Lupin shouted. \"I can explain --\"\\n\\nHarry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh wave\\nof fury.\\n\\n\"I trusted you,\" he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering, out of\\ncontrol, \"and all the time you\\'ve been his friend!\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re wrong,\" said Lupin. \"I haven\\'t been Sirius\\'s friend, but I am\\nnow -- Let me explain....\"\\n\\n\"NO!\" Hermione screamed. \"Harry, don\\'t trust him, he\\'s been helping\\nBlack get into the castle, he wants you dead too -- he\\'s a werewolf!\"\\n\\nThere was a ringing silence. Everyone\\'s eyes were now on Lupin, who\\nlooked remarkably calm, though rather pale.\\n\\n\"Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,\" he said. \"Only one out\\nof three, I\\'m afraid. I have not been helping Sirius get into the castle\\nand I certainly don\\'t want Harry dead. An odd shiver passed over his\\nface. \"But I won\\'t deny that I am a werewolf.\"\\n\\nRon made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a whimper\\nof pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, \"Get\\naway ftom me, werewolf!\"\\n\\nLupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to Hermione\\nand said, \"How long have you known?\"\\n\\n\"Ages,\" Hermione whispered. \"Since I did Professor Snape\\'s essay...\"\\n\\n\"He\\'ll be delighted,\" said Lupin coolly. \"He assigned that essay hoping\\nsomeone would realize what my symptoms meant.... Did you check the lunar\\nchart and realize that I was always ill at the full moon? Or did you\\nrealize that the boggart changed into the moon when it saw me?\"\\n\\n\"Both,\" Hermione said quietly.\\n\\nLupin forced a laugh.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the cleverest witch of your age I\\'ve ever met, Hermione.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not,\" Hermione whispered. \"If I\\'d been a bit cleverer, I\\'d have\\ntold everyone what you are!\"\\n\\n\"But they already know,\" said Lupin. \"At least, the staff do.\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf. Ron gasped. \"Is\\nhe mad?\"\\n\\n\"Some of the staff thought so,\" said Lupin. \"He had to work very hard to\\nconvince certain teachers that I\\'m trustworthy --\"\\n\\n\"AND HE WAS WRONG!\" Harry yelled. \"YOUVE BEEN HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!\"\\nHe was pointing at Black, who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed\\nand sank onto it, his face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt\\nup beside him and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from\\nboth of them, dragging his leg.\\n\\nI have not been helping Sirius,\" said Lupin. \"If you\\'ll give me a\\nchance, I\\'ll explain. Look --\"\\n\\nHe separated Harry\\'s, Ron\\'s and Hermione\\'s wands and threw each back to\\nits owner; Harry caught his, stunned.\\n\\nThere, said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt \"You\\'re\\narmed, we\\'re not. Now will you listen?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t know what to think. Was it a trick?\\n\\n\"If you haven\\'t been helping him,\" he said, with a furious glance at\\nBlack, \"how did you know he was here?\"\\n\\n\"The map,\" said Lupin. \"The Marauder\\'s Map. I was in my office examining\\nit --\"\\n\\n\"You know how to work it?\" Harry said suspiciously.\\n\\n\"Of course I know how to work it,\" said Lupin, waving his hand\\nimpatiently. \"I helped write it. I\\'m Moony -- that was my friends\\'\\nnickname for me at school.\"\\n\\n\"You wrote --?\"\\n\\n\"The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening,\\nbecause I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak\\nout of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed.\\nAnd I was right, wasn\\'t I\"\\n\\nHe had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of\\ndust rose at his feet.\\n\\n\"You might have been wearing your father\\'s old cloak, Harry--\"\\n\\n\"How d\\'you know about the cloak?\"\\n\\n\"The number of times I saw James disappearing under it...,\" said Lupin,\\nwaving an impatient hand again. \"The point is, even if you\\'re wearing an\\nInvisibility Cloak, you still show up on the Marauder\\'s Map. I watched\\nyou cross the grounds and enter Hagrid\\'s hut. Twenty minutes later, you\\nleft Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now\\naccompanied by somebody else.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry. \"No, we weren\\'t!\"\\n\\nI couldn\\'t believe my eyes,\" said Lupin, still pacing, and ignoring\\nHarry\\'s interruption. \"I thought the map must be malfunctioning. How\\ncould he be with you?\" \"No one was with us!\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"And then I saw another dot, moving fast toward you, labeled Sirius\\nBlack.... I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled two of you\\ninto the Whomping Willow --\"\\n\\n\"One of us!\" Ron said angrily.\\n\\n\"No, Ron,\" said Lupin. \"Two of you.\"\\n\\nHe had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron.\\n\\n\"Do you think I could have a look at the rat?\" he said evenly.\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron. \"What\\'s Scabbers got to do with it?\"\\n\\n\"Everything,\" said Lupin. \"Could I see him, please?\"\\n\\nRon hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers emerged,\\nthrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail to stop him\\nescaping. Crookshanks stood up on Black\\'s leg and made a soft hissing\\nnoise.\\n\\nLupin moved closer to Ron. He seemed to be holding his breath as he\\ngazed intently at Scabbers.\\n\\n\"What?\" Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking scared.\\n\"What\\'s my rat got to do with anything?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s not a rat,\" croaked Sirius Black suddenly.\\n\\n\"What d\\'you mean -- of course he\\'s a rat --\"\\n\\n\"No, he\\'s not,\" said Lupin quietly. \"He\\'s a wizard.\"\\n\\n\"An Animagus,\" said Black, \"by the name of Peter Pettigrew.\"\\n\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\\n\\nMOONY, WORMTAIL, PADDFOOT, AND PRONGS\\n\\nIt took a few seconds for the absurdity of this statement to sink in.\\nThen Ron voiced what Harry was thinking.\\n\\n\"You\\'re both mental.\"\\n\\n\"Ridiculous!\" said Hermione faintly.\\n\\n\"Peter Pettigrew\\'s dead!\" said Harry. \"He killed him twelve years ago!\"\\nHe pointed at Black, whose face twitched convulsively.\\n\\n\"I meant to,\" he growled, his yellow teeth bared, \"but little Peter got\\nthe better of me... not this time, though!\"\\n\\nAnd Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at Scabbers; Ron\\nyelled with pain as Black\\'s weight fell on his broken leg.\\n\\n.\"Sirius, NO!\" Lupin yelled, launching himself forwards and dragging\\nBlack away from Ron again, \"WAIT! You can\\'t do it just like that -- they\\nneed to understand -- we\\'ve got to explain --\"\\n\\n\"We can explain afterwards!\" snarled Black, trying to throw Lupin off.\\nOne hand was still clawing the air as it tried to reach Scabbers, who\\nwas squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron\\'s face and neck as he tried\\nto escape.\\n\\n\"They\\'ve -- got -- a -- right -- to -- know -- -everything!\" Lupin\\npanted, still trying to restrain Black. \"Ron\\'s kept him as a pet! There\\nare parts of it even I don\\'t understand, and Harry -- you owe Harry the\\ntruth, Sirius!\"\\n\\nBlack stopped struggling, though his hollowed eyes were still fixed on\\nScabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron\\'s bitten, scratched, ad\\nbleeding hands.\\n\\n\"All right, then,\" Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat.\\n\\n\"Tell them whatever you like. But make it quick, Remus. I want to commit\\nthe murder I was imprisoned for...\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re nutters, both of you,\" said Ron shakily, looking round at Harry\\nand Hermione for support. \"I\\'ve had enough of this. I\\'m off.\"\\n\\nHe tried to heave himself up on his good leg, but Lupin raised his wand\\nagain, pointing it at Scabbers.\\n\\n\"You\\'re going to hear me out, Ron,\" he said quietly. \"Just keep a tight\\nhold on Peter while you listen.\"\\n\\n\"HE\\'S NOT PETER, HE\\'S SCABBERS!\" Ron yelled, trying to fore the rat back\\ninto his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting to hard; Ron swayed and\\noverbalanced, and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed.\\nThen, ignoring Black, Harry turned to Lupin.\\n\\nThere were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die,\" he said. \"A whole street\\nfull of them...\"\\n\\n\"They didn\\'t see what they thought they saw!\" said Black savagely, still\\nwatching Scabbers struggling in Ron\\'s hands.\\n\\n\"Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter,\" said Lupin, nodding. \"I believed\\nit myself -- until I saw the map tonight. Because the Marauder\\'s map\\nnever lies... Peter\\'s alive. Ron\\'s holding him, Harry.\"\\n\\nHarry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, silently:\\nBlack and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense\\nwhatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? Azkaban must have\\nunhinged Black after all -- but why was Lupin playing along with him?\\n\\nThen Hermione spoke, in a trembling, would-be calm sort of voice, as\\nthough trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly.\\n\\n\"But Professor Lupin... Scabbers can\\'t be Pettigrew... it just can\\'t be\\ntrue, you know it can\\'t...\"\\n\\n\"Why can\\'t it be true?\" Lupin said calmly, as though they were in class,\\nand Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experiment with\\ngrindylows.\\n\\n\"Because... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an\\nAnimagus. We did Animagi in class with Professor McGonagall. And I\\nlooked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps\\ntabs on witches and wizards who can become animals; there\\'s a register\\nshowing what animal they become, and their markings and things... and I\\nwent and looked Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have\\nbeen only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew\\'s name wasn\\'t on the\\nlist.\"\\n\\nHarry had barely had time to marvel inwardly at the effort Hermione put\\ninto her homework, when Lupin started to laugh.\\n\\n\"Light again, Hermione!\" he said. \"But the Ministry never knew that here\\nused to be three unregistered Animagi running around Hogwarts.\"\\n\\n\"I you\\'re going to tell them the story, get a move on, Remus,\" said\\nBlack, who was still watching Scabbers\\'s every desperate move. \"I\\'ve\\nwaited twelve years, I\\'m not going to wait much longer.\"\\n\\n\"All right... but you\\'ll need to help me, Sirius,\" said Lupin, I only\\nknow how it began...\"\\n\\nLupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The bedroom\\ndoor had opened of its own accord. All five of them stared at it. Then\\nLupin strode toward it and looked out into the landing.\\n\\n\"No one there...\"\\n\\n\"This place is haunted!\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not,\" said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. \"The\\nShrieking Shack was never haunted.... The screams and howls the\\nvillagers used to hear were made by me.\"\\n\\nHe pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a moment then\\nsaid, \"That\\'s where all of this starts -- with my becoming a werewolf,\\nNone of this could have happened if I hadn\\'t been bitter... and if I\\nhadn\\'t been so foolhardy...\"\\n\\nHe looked sober and tired. Ron started to interrupt, but Hermione, said,\\n\"Shh!\" She was watching Lupin very intently.\\n\\n\"I as a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents tried\\neverything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that\\nProfessor Snape has been making for me is a very recent discovery. It\\nmakes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week, preceding the\\nfull moon, I keep my mind when I transform.... I\\'m able to curl up in my\\noffice, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.\\n\\n\"Before the Wolfsbane Potion was discovered, however, I became a fully\\nfledged monster once a month. It seemed impossible that I would be able\\nto come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren\\'t likely to want their children\\nexposed to me.\\n\\n\"But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympathetic. He said\\nthat as long as we took certain precautions, there was no reason I\\nshouldn\\'t come to school....\" Lupin sighed, and looked directly at\\nHarry. \"I told you, months ago, that the Whomping Willow was planted the\\nyear I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I came\\nto Hogwarts. This house\" -- Lupin looked miserably around the room, --\\n\"the tunnel that leads to it -- they were built for my use. Once a\\nmonth, I was smuggled out of the castle, into this place, to transform.\\nThe tree was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me\\nwhile I was dangerous.\"\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t see where this story was going, but he was listening\\nraptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin\\'s voice was\\nScabbers\\'s frightened squeaking.\\n\\n\"My transformations in those days were -- were terrible. It is very\\npainful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so\\nI bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and\\nthe screaming and thought they were hearing particularly violent\\nspirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor.... Even now, when the house\\nhas been silent for years, the villagers don\\'t dare approach it....\"\\n\\n\"But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had ever been\\nin my life. For the first time ever, I had friends, three great friends.\\nSirius Black... Peter Pettigrew... and, of course, your father, Harry --\\nJames Potter.\"\\n\\n\"Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disappeared\\nonce a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my mother was\\nill, and that I had to go home to see her... I was terrified they would\\ndesert me the moment they found out what I was. But of course, they,\\nlike you, Hermione, worked out the truth....\"\\n\\n\"And they didn\\'t desert me at all. Instead, they did something for me\\nthat would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times\\nof my life. They became Animagi.\"\\n\\n\"My dad too?\" said Harry, astounded.\\n\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Lupin. \"It took them the best part of three years to\\nwork out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the cleverest\\nstudents in the school, and lucky they were, because the Animagus\\ntransformation can go horribly wrong -- one reason the Ministry keeps a\\nclose watch on those attempting to do it. Peter needed all the help he\\ncould get from James and Sirius. Finally, in our fifth year, they\\nmanaged it. They could each turn into a different animal at will.\"\\n\\n\"But how did that help you?\" said Hermione, sounding puzzled.\\n\\n\"They couldn\\'t keep me company as humans, so they kept me company as\\nanimals,\" said Lupin. \"A werewolf is only a danger to people. They\\nsneaked out of the castle every month under James\\'s Invisibility Cloak.\\nThey transformed... Peter, as the smallest, could slip beneath the\\nWillow\\'s attacking branches and touch the knot that freezes it. They\\nwould then slip down the tunnel and join me. Under their influence, I\\nbecame less dangerous. My body was still wolfish, but my mind seemed to\\nbecome less so while I was with them.\"\\n\\n\"Hurry up, Remus,\" snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers with a\\nhorrible sort of hunger on his face.\\n\\n\"I\\'m getting there, Sirius, I\\'m getting there... well, highly exciting\\npossibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. Soon we\\nwere leaving the Shrieking Shack and roaming the school grounds and the\\nvillage by night. Sirius and James transformed into such large animals,\\nthey were able to keep a werewolf in check. I doubt whether any Hogwarts\\nstudents ever found out more about the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade\\nthan we did.... And that\\'s how we came to write the Marauder\\'s Map, and\\nsign it with our nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Peter is Wormtail. James\\nwas Prongs.\"\\n\\n\"What sort of animal --?\" Harry began, but Hermione cut him off.\\n\\n\"That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark with a\\nwerewolf! What if you\\'d given the others the slip, and bitten somebody?\"\\n\\n\"A thought that still haunts me,\" said Lupin heavily. \"And there were\\nnear misses, many of them. We laughed about them afterwards. We were\\nyoung, thoughtless -- carried away with our own cleverness.\"\\n\\nI sometimes felt guilty about betraying Dumbledore\\'s trust, of course...\\nhe had admitted me to Hogwarts when no other headmaster would have done\\nso, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my\\nown and others\\' safety. He never knew I had led three fellow students\\ninto becoming Animagi illegally. But I always managed to forget my\\nguilty feelings every time we sat down to plan our next month\\'s\\nadventure. And I haven\\'t changed...\"\\n\\nLupin\\'s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \"All\\nthis year, I have been battling with myself, wondering whether I should\\ntell Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus. But I didn\\'t do it. Why?\\nBecause I was too cowardly. It would have meant admitting that I\\'d\\nbetrayed his trust while I was at school, admitting that I\\'d led others\\nalong with me... and Dumbledore\\'s trust has meant everything to me. He\\nlet me into Hogwarts as a boy, and he gave me a job when I have been\\nshunned all my adult life, unable to find paid work because of what I\\nam. And so I convinced myself that Sirius was getting into the school\\nusing dark arts he learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had\\nnothing to do with it... so, in a way, Snape\\'s been right about me all\\nalong.\"\\n\\n\"Snape?\" said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers; for the first\\ntime in minutes and looking up at Lupin. \"What\\'s Snape got to do with\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s here, Sirius,\" said Lupin heavily. \"He\\'s teaching here as well.\"\\nHe looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione.\\n\\n\"Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard against my\\nappointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. He has been\\ntelling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted. He has his\\nreasons... you see, Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly\\nkilled him, a trick which involved me --\"\\n\\nBlack made a derisive noise.\\n\\n\"It served him right,\" he sneered. \"Sneaking around, trying to find out\\nwhat we were up to... hoping he could get us expelled....\"\\n\\n\"Severus was very interested in where I went every month.\" Lupin told\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione. \"We were in the same year, you know, and we --\\ner -- didn\\'t like each other very much. He especially disliked James.\\nJealous, I think, of James\\'s talent on the Quidditch field... anyway\\nSnape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as\\nshe led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it\\nwould be -- er -- amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the\\nknot on the tree trunk with a long stick, and he\\'d be able to get in\\nafter me. Well, of course, Snape tried it -- if he\\'d got as far as this\\nhouse, he\\'d have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father, who\\'d\\nheard what Sirius had done, went after Snape and pulled him back, at\\ngreat risk to his life... Snape glimpsed me, though, at the end of the\\ntunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but from that\\ntime on he knew what I was....\"\\n\\n\"So that\\'s why Snape doesn\\'t like you,\" said Harry slowly, \"because he\\nthought you were in on the joke?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" sneered a cold voice from the wall behind Lupin.\\n\\nSeverus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand pointing,\\ndirectly at Lupin.\\n\\nCHAPTER NINETEEN\\n\\nTHE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT\\n\\nHermione screamed. Black leapt to his feet. Harry felt as though he\\'d\\nreceived a huge electric shock.\\n\\n\"I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow,\" said Snape, throwing\\nthe cloak aside, careful to keep this wand pointing directly at Lupin\\'s\\nchest. \"Very useful, Potter, I thank you....\"\\n\\nSnape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed\\ntriumph. \"You\\'re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?\" he said,\\nhis eyes glittering. \"I\\'ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot\\nto take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky\\nI did... lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One\\nglance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this\\npassageway and out of sight.\"\\n\\n\"Severus --\" Lupin began, but Snape overrode him.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve told the headmaster again and again that you\\'re helping your old\\nfriend Black into the castle, Lupin, and here\\'s the proof. Not even I\\ndreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout\\n--\"\\n\\n\"Severus, you\\'re making a mistake,\" said Lupin urgently. \"You haven\\'t\\nheard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry\\n--\"\\n\\n\"Two more for Azkaban tonight,\" said Snape, his eyes now gleaming\\nfanatically. \"I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this....\\nHe was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin... a tame\\nwerewolf --\"\\n\\n\"You fool,\" said Lupin softly. \"Is a schoolboy grudge worth putting an\\ninnocent man back inside Azkaban?\"\\n\\nBANG! Thin, snakelike cords burst from the end of Snape\\'s wand and\\ntwisted themselves around Lupin\\'s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he\\noverbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With a roar of rage,\\nBlack started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between\\nBlack\\'s eyes.\\n\\n\"Give me a reason,\" he whispered. \"Give me a reason to do it, and I\\nswear I will.\"\\n\\nBlack stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which face\\nshowed more hatred.\\n\\nHarry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom to believe.\\nHe glanced around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked just as confused as he\\ndid, still fighting to keep hold on the struggling Scabbers. Hermione,\\nhowever, took an uncertain step toward Snape and said, in a very\\nbreathless voice, \"Professor Snape -- it it wouldn\\'t hurt to hear what\\nthey\\'ve got to say, w -- would it?\"\\n\\n\"Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this school,\"\\nSnape spat. \"You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, in the company\\nof a convicted murderer and a werewolf. For once in your life, hold your\\ntongue.\"\\n\\n\"But if -- if there was a mistake --\"\\n\\n\"KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!\" Snape shouted, looking suddenly quite\\nderanged. \"DON\\'T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON\\'T UNDERSTAND!\" A few sparks\\nshot out of the end of his wand, which was still pointed at Black\\'s\\nface. Hermione fell silent.\\n\\n\"Vengeance is very sweet,\" Snape breathed at Black. \"How I hoped I would\\nbe the one to catch you....\"\\n\\n\"The joke\\'s on you again, Severus,\" Black snarled. \"As long as this boy\\nbrings his rat up to the castle\" -- he jerked his head at Ron -- \"I\\'ll\\ncome quietly....\"\\n\\n\"Up to the castle?\" said Snape silkily. \"I don\\'t think we need to go\\nthat far. All I have to do is call the dementors once we get out of the\\nWillow. They\\'ll be very pleased to see you, Black... pleased enough to\\ngive you a little kiss, I daresay... I --\"\\n\\nWhat little color there was in Blacks face left it.\\n\\n\"You -you\\'ve got to hear me out,\" he croaked. \"The rat -- look at the\\nrat --\"\\n\\nBut there was a mad glint in Snape\\'s eyes that Harry had never seen\\nbefore. He seemed beyond reason.\\n\\n\"Come on, all of you,\" he said. He clicked his fingers, and the ends of\\nthe cords that bound Lupin flew to his hands. \"I\\'ll drag the werewolf.\\nPerhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too --\"\\n\\nBefore he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room in three\\nstrides and blocked the door.\\n\\n\"Get out of the way, Potter, you\\'re in enough trouble already,\" snarled\\nSnape. \"If I hadn\\'t been here to save your skin --\"\\n\\n\"Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year,\"\\nHarry said. \"I\\'ve been alone with him loads of times, having defense\\nlessons against the dementors. If he was helping Black, why didn\\'t he\\njust finish me off then?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf\\'s mind works,\" hissed Snape.\\n\"Get out of the way, Potter.\"\\n\\n\"YOURE PATHETIC!\" Harry yelled. \"JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE A FOOL OF YOU AT\\nSCHOOL YOU WON\\'T EVEN LISTEN --\"\\n\\n\"SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT!\" Snape shrieked, looking\\nmadder than ever. \"Like father, like son, Potter! I have just saved your\\nneck; you should be thanking me on bended knee! You would have been well\\nserved if he\\'d killed you! You\\'d have died like your father, too\\narrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the\\nway, or I will make you. GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!\"\\n\\nHarry made up his mind in a split second. Before Snape could take even\\none step toward him, he had raised his wand.\\n\\n\"Expelliarmus!\" he yelled -- except that his wasn\\'t the only voice that\\nshouted. There was a blast that made the door rattle on its hinges;\\nSnape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, then slid down\\nit to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under his hair. He had\\nbeen knocked out.\\n\\nHarry looked around. Both Ron and Hermione had tried to disarm Snape at\\nexactly the same moment. Snape\\'s wand soared in a high arc and landed on\\nthe bed next to Crookshanks.\\n\\n\"You shouldn\\'t have done that,\" said Black, looking at Harry.\\n\\n\"You should have left him to me....\"\\n\\nHarry avoided Black\\'s eyes. He wasn\\'t sure, even now, that he\\'d done the\\nright thing.\\n\\n\"We attacked a teacher... We attacked a teacher...\" Hermione whimpered,\\nstaring at the lifeless Snape with frightened eyes. \"Oh, we\\'re going to\\nbe in so much trouble --\"\\n\\nLupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down quickly and\\nuntied him. Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms where the ropes had\\ncut into them.\\n\\n\"Thank you, Harry,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I\\'m still not saying I believe you,\" he told Lupin.\\n\\n\"Then it\\'s time we offered you some proof,\" said Lupin. \"You, boy --\\ngive me Peter, please. Now.\"\\n\\nRon clutched Scabbers closer to his chest.\\n\\n\"Come off it,\" he said weakly. \"Are you trying to say he broke out of\\nAzkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers? I mean...\" He looked up at\\nHarry and Hermione for support, \"Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a\\nrat -- there are millions of rats -- how\\'s he supposed to know which one\\nhe\\'s after if he was locked up in Azkaban?\"\\n\\n\"You know, Sirius, that\\'s a fair question,\" said Lupin, turning to Black\\nand frowning slightly. \"How did you find out where he was?\"\\n\\nBlack put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out a\\ncrumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to show the\\nothers.\\n\\nIt was the photograph of Ron and his family that had appeared in the\\nDaily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron\\'s shoulder, was\\nScabbers.\\n\\n\"How did you get this?\" Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck.\\n\\n\"Fudge,\" said Black. \"When he came to inspect Azkaban last year, he gave\\nme his paper. And there was Peter, on the front page on this boy\\'s\\nshoulder... I knew him at once... how many times had I seen him\\ntransform? And the caption said the boy would be going back to\\nHogwarts... to where Harry was...\\n\\n\"My God,\" said Lupin softly, staring from Scabbers to the picture in the\\npaper and back again. \"His front paw...\"\\n\\n\"What about it?\" said Ron defiantly.\\n\\n\"He\\'s got a toe missing,\" said Black.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Lupin breathed. \"So simple... so brilliant... he cut it off\\nhimself?\"\\n\\n\"Just before he transformed,\" said Black. \"When I cornered him, he\\nyelled for the whole street to hear that I\\'d betrayed Lily and James.\\nThen, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand\\nbehind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet of himself -- and\\nsped down into the sewer with the other rats....\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you ever hear, Ron?\" said Lupin. \"The biggest bit of Peter they\\nfound was his finger.\"\\n\\n\"Look, Scabbers probably had a fight with another rat or something! He\\'s\\nbeen in my family for ages, right --\"\\n\\n\"Twelve years, in fact,\" said Lupin. \"Didn\\'t you ever wonder why he was\\nliving so long?\"\\n\\n\"We -- we\\'ve been taking good care of him!\" said Ron.\\n\\n\"Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?\" said Lupin. \"I\\'d\\nguess he\\'s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius was on the\\nloose again....\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s been scared of that mad cat!\" said Ron, nodding toward\\nCrookshanks, who was still purring on the bed.\\n\\nBut that wasn\\'t right, Harry thought suddenly... Scabbers had been\\nlooking ill before he met Crookshanks... ever since Ron\\'s return from\\nEgypt... since the time when Black had escaped....\\n\\n\"This cat isn\\'t mad,\" said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony hand\\nand stroked Crookshanks\\'s fluffy head. \"He\\'s the most intelligent of his\\nkind I\\'ve ever met. He recognized Peter for what he was right away. And\\nwhen he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted\\nme.... Finally, I managed to communicate to him what I was after, and\\nhe\\'s been helping me. .. \"What do you mean?\" breathed Hermione.\\n\\n\"He tried to bring Peter to me, but couldn\\'t... so he stole the\\npasswords into Gryffindor Tower for me.... As I understand it, he took\\nthem from a boy\\'s bedside table....\"\\n\\nHarry\\'s brain seemed to be sagging under the weight of what he was\\nhearing. It was absurd... and yet...\\n\\n\"But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it.\" croaked Black.\\n\"This cat -- Crookshanks, did you call him? -- told me Peter had left\\nblood on the sheets.... I supposed he bit himself... Well, faking his\\nown death had worked once.\"\\n\\nThese words jolted Harry to his senses.\\n\\n\"And why did he fake his death?\" he said furiously. \"Because he knew you\\nwere about to kill him like you killed my parents!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Lupin, \"Harry-\"\\n\\n\"And now you\\'ve come to finish him off!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have,\" said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers.\\n\\n\"Then I should\\'ve let Snape take you!\" Harry shouted.\\n\\n\"Harry,\" said Lupin hurriedly, \"don\\'t you see? All this time we\\'ve\\nthought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him down -- but\\nit was the other way around, don\\'t you see? Peter betrayed your mother\\nand father -- Sirius tracked Peter down --\"\\n\\n\"THAT\\'S NOT TRUE!\" Harry yelled. \"HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO\\nBEFORE YOU TURNED UP. HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!\"\\n\\nHe was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the sunken eyes\\nwere suddenly over bright.\\n\\n\"Harry... I as good as killed them,\" he croaked. \"I persuaded Lily and\\nJames to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him\\nas Secret-Keeper instead of me.... I\\'m to blame, I know it.... The night\\nthey died, I\\'d arranged to check on Peter, make sure he was still safe,\\nbut when I arrived at his hiding place, he\\'d gone. Yet there was no sign\\nof a struggle. It didn\\'t feel right. I was scared. I set out for your\\nparents\\' house straight away. And when I saw their house, destroyed, and\\ntheir bodies... I realized what Peter must\\'ve done... what I\\'d done....\"\\n\\nHis voice broke. He turned away.\\n\\n\"Enough of this,\" said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his voice\\nHarry had never heard before. \"There\\'s one certain way to prove what\\nreally happened. Ron, give me that rat.\"\\n\\n\"What are you going to do with him if I give him to you?\" Ron asked\\nLupin tensely.\\n\\n\"Force him to show himself,\" said Lupin. \"If he really is a rat, it\\nwon\\'t hurt him.\"\\n\\nRon hesitated. Then at long last, he held out Scabbers and Lupin took\\nhim. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, twisting and turning,\\nhis tiny black eyes bulging in his head. \"Ready, Sirius?\" said Lupin.\\n\\nBlack had already retrieved Snape\\'s wand from the bed. He approached\\nLupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly seemed to be\\nburning in his face.\\n\\n\"Together?\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\"I think so,,, said Lupin, holding Scabbers tightly in one hand and his\\nwand in the other. \"On the count of three. One -- two -- THREE!\"\\n\\nA flash of blue-white light erupted from both wands; for a moment,\\nScabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly -- Ron\\nyelled -- the rat fell and hit the floor. There was another blinding\\nflash of light and then --\\n\\nIt was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head was\\nshooting upward from the ground; limbs were sprouting; a moment later, a\\nman was standing where Scabbers had been, cringing and wringing his\\nhands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his\\nback was standing up.\\n\\nHe was a very short man, hardly taller than Harry and Hermione. His\\nthin, colorless hair was unkempt and there was a large bald patch on\\ntop. He had the shrunken appearance of a plump man who has lost a lot of\\nweight in a short time. His skin looked grubby, almost like Scabbers\\'s\\nfur, and something of the rat lingered around his pointed nose and his\\nvery small, watery eyes. He looked around at them all, his breathing\\nfast and shallow. Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again.\\n\\n\"Well, hello, Peter,\" said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats frequently\\nerupted into old school friends around him. \"Long time, no see.\\n\\n\"S -- Sirius... R -- Remus...\" Even Pettigrew\\'s voice was squeaky.\\nAgain, his eyes darted toward the door. \"My friends... my old\\nfriends...\"\\n\\nBlack\\'s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, gave him a\\nwarning took, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice light and\\ncasual.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve been having a little chat, Peter, about what happened the night\\nLily and James died. You might have missed the finer points while you\\nwere squeaking around down there on the bed --\"\\n\\n\"Remus,\" gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat breaking\\nout over his pasty face, \"you don\\'t believe him, do you...? He tried to\\nkill me, Remus....\"\\n\\n\"So we\\'ve heard,\" said Lupin, more coldly. \"I\\'d like to clear up one or\\ntwo little matters with you, Peter, if you\\'ll be so --\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s come to try and kill me again!\" Pettigrew squeaked suddenly,\\npointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle finger, because\\nhis index was missing. \"He killed Lily and James and now he\\'s going to\\nkill me too.... You\\'ve got to help me, Remus....\"\\n\\nBlack\\'s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at Pettigrew\\nwith his fathomless eyes.\\n\\n\"No one\\'s going to try and kill you until we\\'ve sorted a few things\\nout,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"Sorted things out?\" squealed Pettigrew, looking wildly about him once\\nmore, eyes taking in the boarded windows and, again\\' the only door. \"I\\nknew he\\'d come after me! I knew he\\'d be back for me! I\\'ve been waiting\\nfor this for twelve years!\"\\n\\n\"You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?\" said Lupin, his\\nbrow furrowed. \"When nobody has ever done it before?\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!\" Pettigrew\\nshouted shrilly. \"How else did he get out of there? I suppose\\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks!\"\\n\\nBlack started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the\\nwhole room.\\n\\n\"Voldemort, teach me tricks?\" he said.\\n\\nPettigrew flinched as though Black had brandished a whip at him.\\n\\n\"What, scared to hear your old master\\'s name?\" said Black. I don\\'t blame\\nyou, Peter. His lot aren\\'t very happy with you, are they?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know what you mean, Sirius --\" muttered Pettigrew, his breathing\\nfaster than ever. His whole face was shining with sweat now.\\n\\n\"You haven\\'t been hiding from me for twelve years,\" said Black. \"You\\'ve\\nbeen hiding from Voldemort\\'s old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban,\\nPeter... They all think you\\'re dead, or you\\'d have to answer to them....\\nI\\'ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in their sleep. Sounds\\nlike they think the double-crosser double-crossed them. Voldemort went\\nto the Potters\\' on your information... and Voldemort met his downfall\\nthere. And not all Voldemort\\'s supporters ended up in Azkaban, did they?\\nThere are still plenty out here, biding their time, pretending they\\'ve\\nseen the error of their ways.\\n\\nIf they ever got wind that you were still alive, Peter --\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know... what you\\'re talking about...,\" said Pettigrew again, more\\nshrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and looked up at\\nLupin. \"You don\\'t believe this -- this madness, Remus --\"\\n\\n\"I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an innocent\\nman would want to spend twelve years as a rat,\" said Lupin evenly.\\n\\n\"Innocent, but scared!\" squealed Pettigrew. \"If Voldemort\\'s supporters\\nwere after me, it was because I put one of their best men in Azkaban --\\nthe spy, Sirius Black!\"\\n\\nBlack\\'s face contorted.\\n\\n\"How dare you,\" he growled, sounding suddenly like the bearsized dog he\\nhad been. I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever sneak around people\\nwho were stronger and more powerful than myself? But you, Peter -- I\\'ll\\nnever understand why I didn\\'t see you were the spy from the start. You\\nalways liked big friends who\\'d look after you, didn\\'t you? It used to be\\nus... me and Remus... and James....\\n\\nPettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath.\\n\\n\"Me, a spy... must be out of your mind... never... don\\'t know how you\\ncan say such a --\"\\n\\n\"Lily and James only made you Secret-Keeper because I suggested it,\"\\nBlack hissed, so venomously that Pettigrew took a step backward. \"I\\nthought it was the perfect plan... a bluff... Voldemort would be sure to\\ncome after me, would never dream they\\'d use a weak, talentless thing\\nlike you.... It must have been the finest moment of your miserable life,\\ntelling Voldemort you could hand him the Potters.\"\\n\\nPettigrew was muttering distractedly; Harry caught words like\\n\"far-fetched\" and \"lunacy,\" but he couldn\\'t help paying more attention\\nto the ashen color of Pettigrew\\'s face and the way his eyes continued to\\ndart toward the windows and door.\\n\\n\"Professor Lupin?\" said Hermione timidly. \"Can -- can I say something?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, Hermione,\" said Lupin courteously.\\n\\n\"Well -- Scabbers -- I mean, this -- this man -- he\\'s been sleeping in\\nHarry\\'s dormitory for three years. If he\\'s working for You-Know-Who, how\\ncome he never tried to hurt Harry before now?\"\\n\\n\"There!\" said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed hand.\\n\"Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of Harry\\'s head!\\nWhy should I?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll tell you why,\" said Black. \"Because you never did anything for\\nanyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort\\'s been in\\nhiding for fifteen years, they say he\\'s half dead. You weren\\'t about to\\ncommit murder right under Albus Dumbledore\\'s nose, for a wreck of a\\nwizard who\\'d lost all of his power, were you? You\\'d want to be quite\\nsure he was the biggest bully in the playground before you went back to\\nhim, wouldn\\'t you? Why else did you find a wizard family to take you in?\\nKeeping an ear out for news, weren\\'t YOU, Peter? Just in case your old\\nprotector regained strength, and it was safe to rejoin him....\"\\n\\nPettigrew opened his mouth and closed it several times. He seemed to\\nhave lost the ability to talk.\\n\\n\"Er -- Mr. Black -- Sirius?\" said Hermione.\\n\\nBlack jumped at being addressed like this and stared at Hermione as\\nthough he had never seen anything quite like her.\\n\\n\"If you don\\'t mind me asking, how -- how did you get out of Azkaban, if\\nyou didn\\'t use Dark Magic?\"\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. \"Exactly!\\nPrecisely what I --\"\\n\\nBut Lupin silenced him with a look. Black was frowning slightly at\\nHermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He seemed to be\\npondering his answer.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know how I did it,\" he said slowly. \"I think the only reason I\\nnever lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn\\'t a happy\\nthought, so the dementors couldn\\'t suck it out of me... but it kept me\\nsane and knowing who I am... helped me keep my powers... so when it all\\nbecame ... too much... I could transform in my cell... become a dog.\\nDementors can\\'t see, you know....\" He swallowed. \"They feel their way\\ntoward people by feeding off their emotions.... They could tell that my\\nfeelings were less -- less human, less complex when I was a dog... but\\nthey thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone else in\\nthere, so it didn\\'t trouble them. But I was weak, very weak, and I had\\nno hope of driving them away from me without a wand....\"\\n\\n\"But then I saw Peter in that picture... I realized he was at Hogwarts\\nwith Harry... perfectly positioned to act, if one hint reached his ears\\nthat the Dark Side was gathering strength again....\"\\n\\nPettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but staring all\\nthe while at Black as though hypnotized.\\n\\n\"... ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies... and to\\ndeliver the last Potter to them. if he gave them Harry, who\\'d dare say\\nhe\\'d betrayed Lord Voldemort? He\\'d be welcomed back with honors....\\n\\n\"So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who knew Peter\\nwas still alive....\"\\n\\nHarry remembered what Mr. Weasley had told Mrs. Wealsey. \"The guards say\\nhe\\'s been talking in his sleep... always the same words... \\'He\\'s at\\nHogwarts.\\'\"\\n\\n\"It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head, and the dementors\\ncouldn\\'t destroy it.... It wasn\\'t a happy feeling... it was an\\nobsession... but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night\\nwhen they opened my door to bring food, I slipped past them as a dog....\\nIt\\'s so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were\\nconfused.... I was thin, very thin... thin enough to slip through the\\nbars.... I swam as a dog back to the mainland.... I journeyed north and\\nslipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I\\'ve been living in the\\nforest ever since, except when I came to watch the Quidditch, of course.\\nYou fly as well as your father did, Harry....\"\\n\\nHe looked at Harry, who did not look away.\\n\\n\"Believe me,\" croaked Black. \"Believe me, Harry. I never betrayed James\\nand Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.\"\\n\\nAnd at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, he\\nnodded.\\n\\n\"No!\"\\n\\nPettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry\\'s nod had been his own\\ndeath sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, groveling, his hands\\nclasped in front of him as though praying.\\n\\n\"Sirius -- it\\'s me... it\\'s Peter... your friend... you wouldn\\'t --\"\\n\\nBlack kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled.\\n\\n\"There\\'s enough filth on my robes without you touching them,\" said\\nBlack.\\n\\n\"Remus!\" Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writhing\\nimploringly in front of him. \"You don\\'t believe this wouldn\\'t Sirius\\nhave told you they\\'d changed the plan?\"\\n\\n\"Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,\" said Lupin. \"I assume that\\'s\\nwhy you didn\\'t tell me, Sirius?\" he said casually over Pettigrews head.\\n\\n\"Forgive me, Remus,\" said Black.\\n\\n\"Not at all, Padfoot, old friend,\" said Lupin, who was now rolling up\\nhis sleeves. \"And will you, in turn, forgive me for believing you were\\nthe spy?\"\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his\\ngaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. \"Shall we kill him\\ntogether?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I think so,\" said Lupin grimly.\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t... you won\\'t...,\" gasped Pettigrew. And he scrambled\\naround to Ron.\\n\\n\"Ron... haven\\'t I been a good friend... a good pet? You won\\'t let them\\nkill me, Ron, will you... you\\'re on my side, aren\\'t you.\\n\\nBut Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion.\\n\\n\"I let you sleep in my bed!\" he said.\\n\\n\"Kind boy... kind master...\" Pettigrew crawled toward Ron \"You won\\'t let\\nthem do it.... I was your rat.... I was a good pet....\"\\n\\n\"If you made a better rat than a human, it\\'s not much to boast about,\\nPeter,\" said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, wrenched\\nhis broken leg out of Pettigrew\\'s reach. Pettigrew turned on his knees,\\nstaggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione\\'s robes.\\n\\n\"Sweet girl... clever girl... you -- you won\\'t let them.... Help me....\"\\n\\nHermione pulled her robes out of Pettigrew\\'s clutching hands and backed\\naway against the wall, looking horrified.\\n\\nPettigrew knelt, trembling uncontrollably, and-turned his head slowly\\ntoward Harry.\\n\\n\"Harry... Harry... you look just like your father... just like him....\"\\n\\n\"HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?\" roared Black. \"HOW DARE YOU FACE HIM? HOW\\nDARE YOU TALK ABOUT JAMES IN FRONT OF HIM?\"\\n\\n\"Harry,\" whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands outstretched.\\n\"Harry, James wouldn\\'t have wanted me killed.... James would have\\nunderstood, Harry... he would have shown me mercy...\"\\n\\nBoth Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew\\'s shoulders, and\\nthrew him backward onto the floor. He sat there, twitching with terror,\\nstaring up at them.\\n\\n\"You sold Lily and James to Voldemort,\" said Black, who was shaking too.\\n\"Do you deny it?\"\\n\\nPettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an oversized,\\nbalding baby, cowering on the floor.\\n\\n\"Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord... you have no\\nidea... he has weapons you can\\'t imagine.... I was scared, Sirius, I was\\nnever brave like you and Remus and James. I never meant it to happen....\\nHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named forced me --\"\\n\\n\"DON\\'T LIE!\" bellowed Black. \"YOU\\'D BEEN PASSING INFORMATION TO HIM FOR\\nA YEAR BEFORE LILY AND JAMES DIED! YOU WERE HIS SPY!\"\\n\\n\"He -- he was taking over everywhere!\" gasped Pettigrew. \"Wh -- what was\\nthere to be gained by refusing him?\"\\n\\n\"What was there to be gained by fighting the most evil wizard who has\\never existed?\" said Black, with a terrible fury in his face. \"Only\\ninnocent lives, Peter!\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t understand!\" whined Pettigrew. \"He would have killed me,\\nSirius!\"\\n\\n\"THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED!\" roared Black. \"DIED RATHER THAN BETRAY YOUR\\nFRIENDS, AS WE WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU!\"\\n\\nBlack and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised.\\n\\n\"You should have realized,\" said Lupin quietly, \"if Voldemort didn\\'t\\nkill you, we would. Good-bye, Peter.\"\\n\\nHermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the wall.\\n\\n\"NO!\" Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front Pettigrew,\\nfacing the wands. \"You can\\'t kill him,\" he said breathlessly. \"You\\ncan\\'t.\"\\n\\nBlack and Lupin both looked staggered.\\n\\n\"Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,\" Black\\nsnarled. \"This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die too,\\nwithout turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin meant more\\nto him than your whole family.\"\\n\\n\"I know,\" Harry panted. \"We\\'ll take him up to the castle. We\\'ll hand him\\nover to the dementors.... He can go to Azkaban... but don\\'t kill him.\"\\n\\n\"Harry!\" gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry\\'s knees.\\n\"You -- thank you -- it\\'s more than I deserve -- thank you --\"\\n\\n\"Get off me,\" Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew\\'s hands off him in disgust.\\n\"I\\'m not doing this for you. I\\'m doing it because -- I don\\'t reckon my\\ndad would\\'ve wanted them to become killers -- just for you.\"\\n\\nNo one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath was coming\\nin wheezes as he clutched his chest. Black and Lupin were looking at\\neach other. Then, with one movement, they lowered their wands.\\n\\n\"You\\'re the only person who has the right to decide, Harry,\" said Black.\\n\"But think... think what he did....\"\\n\\n\"He can go to Azkaban,\" Harry repeated. \"If anyone deserves that place,\\nhe does....\"\\n\\nPettigrew was still wheezing behind him.\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said Lupin. \"Stand aside, Harry.\"\\n\\nHarry hesitated.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to tie him up,\" said Lupin. \"That\\'s all, I swear.\"\\n\\nHarry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin\\'s wand this\\ntime, and next moment, Pettigrew was wriggling on the floor, bound and\\ngagged.\\n\\n\"But if you transform, Peter,\" growled Black, his own wand pointing at\\nPettigrew too, \"we will kill you. You agree, Harry?\"\\n\\nHarry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded so that\\nPettigrew could see him.\\n\\n\"Right,\" said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. \"Ron, I can\\'t mend bones\\nnearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it\\'s best if we just strap\\nyour leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing.\"\\n\\nHe hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron\\'s leg with his wand, and\\nmuttered, \"Ferula.\" Bandages spun up Ron\\'s leg, strapping it tightly to\\na splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron put his weight gingerly on\\nthe leg and didn\\'t wince.\\n\\n\"That\\'s better,\" he said. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n\"What about Professor Snape?\" said Hermione in a small voice, looking\\ndown at Snape\\'s prone figure.\\n\\n\"There\\'s nothing seriously wrong with him,\" said Lupin, bending over\\nSnape and checking his pulse. \"You were just a little --\\noverenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er -- perhaps it will be best if we\\ndon\\'t revive him until we\\'re safety back in the castle. We can take him\\nlike this....\"\\n\\nHe muttered, \"Mobilicorpus.\" As though invisible strings were tied to\\nSnape\\'s wrists, neck, and knees, he was pulled into a standing position,\\nhead still lolling unpleasantly, like a grotesque puppet. He hung a few\\ninches above the ground, his limp feet dangling. Lupin picked up the\\nInvisibility Cloak and tucked it safely into his pocket.\\n\\n\"And two of us should be chained to this,\" said Black, nudging Pettigrew\\nwith his toe. \"Just to make sure.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll do it,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n\"And me,\" said Ron savagely, limping forward.\\n\\nBlack conjured heavy manacles from thin air; soon Pettigrew was upright\\nagain, left arm chained to Lupin\\'s right, right arm to Ron\\'s left. Ron\\'s\\nface was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers\\'s true identity as a\\npersonal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the bed and led the way\\nout of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jauntily high.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY\\n\\nTHE DEMENTOR\\'S KISS\\n\\nHarry had never been part of a stranger group. Crookshanks led the way\\ndown the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron went next, looking like\\nentrants in a six-legged race. Next came Professor Snape, drifting\\ncreepily along, his toes hitting each stair as they descended, held up\\nby his own wand, which was being pointed at him by Sirius. Harry and\\nHermione brought up the rear.\\n\\nGetting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron\\nhad to turn sideways to manage it; Lupin still had Pettigrew covered\\nwith his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in\\nsingle file. Crookshanks was still in the lead. Harry went right after\\nBlack, who was still making Snape drift along ahead of them; he kept\\nbumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression\\nBlack was making no effort to prevent this.\\n\\n\"You know what this means?\" Black said abruptly to Harry as they made\\ntheir slow progress along the tunnel. \"Turning Pettigrew in?\"\\n\\n\"You\\' re free,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Yes...,\" said Black. \"But I\\'m also -- I don\\'t know if anyone ever told\\nyou -- I\\'m your godfather.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I knew that,\" said Harry.\\n\\n\"Well... your parents appointed me your guardian,\" said Black stiffly.\\n\"If anything happened to them...\"\\n\\nHarry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant?\\n\\n\"I\\'ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and\\nuncle,\" said Black. \"But... well... think about it. Once my name\\'s\\ncleared... if you wanted a... a different home...\"\\n\\nSome sort of explosion took place in the pit of Harry\\'s stomach.\\n\\n\"What -- live with you?\" he said, accidentally cracking his head on a\\nbit of rock protruding from the ceiling. \"Leave the Dursleys?\"\\n\\n\"Of course, I thought you wouldn\\'t want to,\" said Black quickly. \"I\\nunderstand, I just thought I\\'d --\"\\n\\n\"Are you insane?\" said Harry, his voice easily as croaky as Black\\'s.\\n\\n\"Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can\\nI move in?\"\\n\\nBlack turned right around to look at him; Snape\\'s head was scraping the\\nceiling but Black didn\\'t seem to care.\\n\\n\"You want to?\" he said. \"You mean it?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I mean it!\" said Harry.\\n\\nBlack\\'s gaunt face broke into the first true smile Harry had seen upon\\nit. The difference it made was startling, as though a person ten years\\nyounger were shining through the starved mask; for a moment, he was\\nrecognizable as the man who had laughed at Harry\\'s parents\\' wedding.\\n\\nThey did not speak again until they had reached the end of the tunnel.\\nCrookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his paw to the\\nknot on the trunk, because Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron clambered upward\\nwithout any sound of savaging branches.\\n\\nBlack saw Snape up through the hole, then stood back for Harry and\\nHermione to pass. At last, all of them were out.\\n\\nThe grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the distant\\nwindows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Pettigrew was still\\nwheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry\\'s mind was buzzing. He was\\ngoing to leave the Dursleys. He was going to live with Sirius Black, his\\nparents\\' best friend.... He felt dazed.... What would happen when he\\ntold the Dursleys he was going to live with the convict they\\'d seen on\\ntelevision... !\\n\\n\"One wrong move, Peter,\" said Lupin threateningly ahead. His wand was\\nstill pointed sideways at Pettigrew\\'s chest.\\n\\nSilently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights growing\\nslowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of Black, his chin\\nbumping on his chest. And then -\\n\\nA cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the ground. Their\\nparty was bathed in moonlight.\\n\\nSnape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had stopped abruptly.\\nBlack froze. He flung out one arm to make Harry and Hermione stop.\\n\\nHarry could see Lupin\\'s silhouette. He had gone rigid. Then his limbs\\nbegan to shake.\\n\\n\"Oh, my --\" Hermione gasped. \"He didn\\'t take his potion tonight! He\\'s\\nnot safe!\"\\n\\n\"Run,\" Black whispered. \"Run. Now.\"\\n\\nBut Harry couldn\\'t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and Lupin. He leapt\\nforward but Black caught him around the chest and threw him back.\\n\\n\"Leave it to me -- RUN!\"\\n\\nThere was a terrible snarling noise. Lupin\\'s head was lengthening. So\\nwas his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting visibly on\\nhis face and hands, which were curling into clawed paws. Crookshanks\\'s\\nhair was on end again; he was backing away --\\n\\nAs the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disappeared from\\nHarry\\'s side. He had transformed. The enormous, bearlike dog bounded\\nforward. As the werewolf wrenched itself free of the manacle binding it,\\nthe dog seized it about the neck and pulled it backward, away from Ron\\nand Pettigrew. They were locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other.\\n\\nHarry stood, transfixed by the sight, too intent upon the battle to\\nnotice anything else. It was Hermione\\'s scream that alerted him --\\n\\nPettigrew had dived for Lupin\\'s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady on his\\nbandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light -- and Ron lay\\nmotionless on the ground. Another bang -- Crookshanks flew into the air\\nand back to the earth in a heap.\\n\\n\"Expelliarmus.\" Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Pettigrew;\\nLupin\\'s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. \"Stay where you\\nare!\" Harry shouted, running forward.\\n\\nToo late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail whip\\nthrough the manacle on Ron\\'s outstretched arm and heard a scurrying\\nthrough the grass.\\n\\nThere was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the werewolf\\ntaking flight; it was galloping into the forest --\\n\\n\"Sirius, he\\'s gone, Pettigrew transformed!\" Harry yelled.\\n\\nBlack was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and back, but at\\nHarry\\'s words he scrambled up again, and in an instant, the sound of his\\npaws faded to silence as he pounded away across the grounds.\\n\\nHarry and Hermione dashed over to Ron.\\n\\n\"What did he do to him?\" Hermione whispered. Ron\\'s eyes were only\\nhalf-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could\\nhear him breathing, but he didn\\'t seem to recognize them.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know....\"\\n\\nHarry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both gone... they had\\nno one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair.\\n\\n\"We\\'d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,\" said Harry,\\npushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. \"Come --\"\\n\\nBut then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a yelping, a\\nwhining: a dog in pain....\\n\\n\"Sirius,\" Harry muttered, staring into the darkness.\\n\\nHe had a moment\\'s indecision, but there was nothing they could do for\\nRon at the moment, and by the sound of it, Black was in trouble --\\n\\nHarry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping seemed to\\nbe coming from the ground near the edge of the lake. They pelted toward\\nit, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold without realizing what it\\nmust mean -\\n\\nThe yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, they saw\\nwhy -- Sirius had turned back into a man. He was crouched on all fours,\\nhis hands over his head.\\n\\n\\'Nooo,\" he moaned. \\'Nooo... please....\"\\n\\nAnd then Harry saw them. Dementors, at least a hundred of them, gliding\\nin a black mass around the lake toward them. He spun around, the\\nfamiliar, icy cold penetrating his insides, fog starting to obscure his\\nvision; more were appearing out of the darkness on every side; they were\\nencircling them....\\n\\n\"Herrnione, think of something happy!\" Harry yelled, raising his wand,\\nblinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his head to rid\\nit of the faint screaming that had started inside it --\\n\\nI\\'m going to live with my godfather. I\\'m leaving the Dursleys.\\n\\nHe forced himself to think of Black, and only Black, and began to chant:\\n\"Expecto patronum! Expecto patronum!\"\\n\\nBlack gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the ground,\\npale as death.\\n\\nHe\\'ll be all right. I\\'m going to go and live with him.\\n\\n\"Expecto patronum! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum!\"\\n\\n\"Expecto --\" Hermione whispered, \"expecto -- expecto --\"\\n\\nBut she couldn\\'t do it. The dementors were closing in, barely ten feet\\nfrom them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were\\ngetting closer....\\n\\n\"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\" Harry yelled, trying to blot the screaming from his\\nears. \"EXPECTO PATRONUM!\"\\n\\nA thin wisp of silver escaped his wand and hovered like mist before him.\\nAt the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next to him. He was\\nalone... completely alone....\\n\\n\"Expecto -- expecto patronum --\"\\n\\nHarry felt his knees hit the cold grass. Fog was clouding his eyes. With\\na huge effort, he fought to remember -- Sirius was innocent -- innocent\\n-- We\\'ll be okay -- I\\' mgoing to live with him --\\n\\n\"Ex ecto patronum!\" he gasped.\\n\\nBy the feeble light of his formless Patronus, He saw a dementor halt,\\nvery close to him. It couldn\\'t walk through the cloud of silver mist\\nHarry had conjured. A dead, slimy hand slid out from under the cloak. It\\nmade a gesture as though to sweep the Patronus aside.\\n\\n\"No -- no --\" Harry gasped. \"He\\'s innocent... expecto expecto patronum\\n--\"\\n\\nHe could feet them watching him, hear their rattling breath like an evil\\nwind around him. The nearest dementor seemed to be considering him. Then\\nit raised both its rotting hands -- and lowered its hood.\\n\\nWhere there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed\\nskin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth... a\\ngaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death\\nrattle.\\n\\nA paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn\\'t move or speak. His\\nPatronus flickered and died.\\n\\nWhite fog was blinding him. He had to fight... expecto patronum ... he\\ncouldn\\'t see... and in the distance, he heard the familiar screaming...\\nexpecto patronum... he groped in the mist for Sirius, and found his\\narm... they weren\\'t going to take him....\\n\\nBut a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached themselves around\\nHarry\\'s neck. They were forcing his face upward.... He could feel its\\nbreath.... It was going to get rid of him first.... He could feel its\\nputrid breath.... His mother was screaming in his ears.... She was going\\nto be the last thing he ever heard --\\n\\nAnd then, through the fog that was drowning him, he thought he saw a\\nsilvery light growing brighter and brighter... He felt himself fall\\nforward onto the grass.... Facedown, too weak to move, sick and shaking,\\nHarry opened his eyes. The dementor must have released him. The blinding\\nlight was illuminating the grass around him.... The screaming had\\nstopped, the cold was ebbing away...\\n\\nSomething was driving the dementors back.... It was circling around him\\nand Black and Hermione.... They were leaving....\\n\\nThe air was warm again....\\n\\nWith every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his head a\\nfew inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away across the\\nlake.... Eyes blurred with sweat, Harry tried to make out what it\\nwas.... It was as bright as a unicorn.... Fighting to stay conscious,\\nHarry watched it canter to a halt as it reached the opposite shore. For\\na moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, somebody welcoming it back...\\nraising his hand to pat it... someone who looked strangely familiar ...\\nbut it couldn\\'t be...\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t understand. He couldn\\'t think anymore. He felt the last of\\nhis strength leave him, and his head hit the ground as he fainted.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\\n\\nHERMIONE\\'S SECRET\\n\\nShocking business... shocking... miracle none of them died... never\\nheard the like... by thunder, it was lucky you were there, Snape....\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Minister.\"\\n\\n\"Order of Merlin, Second Class, I\\'d say. First Class, if I can wangle\\nit!\"\\n\\n\"Thank you very much indeed, Minister.\"\\n\\n\"Nasty cut you\\'ve got there.... Black\\'s work, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"As a matter of fact, it was Potter, Weasley, and Granger, Minister....\"\\n\\n\"No!\"\\n\\n\"Black had bewitched them, I saw it immediately. A Confundus Charm, to\\njudge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he\\nwas innocent. They weren\\'t responsible for their actions. On the other\\nhand, their interference might have permitted Black to escape.... They\\nobviously thought they were going to catch Black single-handed. They\\'ve\\ngot away with a great deal before now... I\\'m afraid it\\'s given them a\\nrather high opinion of themselves... and of course Potter has always\\nbeen allowed an extraordinary amount of license by the headmaster --\"\\n\\n\"Ah, well, Snape... Harry Potter, you know... we\\'ve all got a bit of a\\nblind spot where he\\'s concerned.\"\\n\\n\"And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment?\\nPersonally, I try and treat him like any other student. And any other\\nstudent would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his\\nfriends into such danger. Consider, Minister -- against all school rules\\n-- after all the precautions put in place for his protection --\\nout-of-bounds, at night, consorting with a werewolf and a murderer --\\nand I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally\\ntoo --\"\\n\\n\"Well, well... we shall see, Snape, we shall see.... The boy has\\nundoubtedly been foolish....\"\\n\\nHarry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. The\\nwords he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from his ears to\\nhis brain, so that it was difficult to understand.... His limbs felt\\nlike lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift.... He wanted to lie here, on\\nthis comfortable bed, forever....\\n\\n\"What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors... you\\'ve really\\nno idea what made them retreat, Snape?\"\\n\\n\"No, Minister... by the time I had come \\'round they were heading back to\\ntheir positions at the entrances....\"\\n\\n\"Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl --\"\\n\\n\"All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and gagged Black,\\nnaturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all straight back to\\nthe castle.\"\\n\\nThere was a pause. Harry\\'s brain seemed to be moving a little faster,\\nand as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stomach....\\n\\nHe opened his eyes.\\n\\nEverything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his glasses. He\\nwas lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of the ward, he\\ncould make out Madam Pomfrey with her back to him, bending over a bed.\\nHarry squinted. Ron\\'s red hair was visible beneath Madam Pomfrey\\'s arm.\\n\\nHarry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right lay\\nHermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too.\\nShe looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was awake, pressed a\\nfinger to her lips, then pointed to the hospital wing door. It was ajar,\\nand the voices of Cornelius Fudge and Snape were coming through it from\\nthe corridor outside.\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to Harry\\'s bed.\\nHe turned to took at her. She was carrying the largest block of\\nchocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small boulder.\\n\\n\"Ah, you\\'re awake!\" she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on\\nHarry\\'s bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small hammer.\\n\\n\"How\\'s Ron?\" said Harry and Hermione together.\\n\\n\"He\\'ll live, said Madam Pomfrey grimly. \"As for you two you\\'ll be\\nstaying here until I\\'m satisfied you\\'re -- Potter, what do you think\\nyou\\'re doing?\"\\n\\nHarry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up his\\nwand.\\n\\n\"I need to see the headmaster,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Potter,\" said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, \"it\\'s all right. They\\'ve got\\nBlack. He\\'s locked away upstairs. The dementors will be performing the\\nkiss any moment now --\"\\n\\n\"WHAT?\"\\n\\nHarry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But his shout\\nhad been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cornelius Fudge and\\nSnape had entered the ward.\\n\\n\"Harry, Harry, what\\'s this?\" said Fudge, looking agitated. \"You should\\nbe in bed -- has he had any chocolate?\" he asked Madam Pomfrey\\nanxiously.\\n\\n\"Minister, listen!\" Harry said. \"Sirius Black\\'s innocent! Peter\\nPettigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can\\'t let the\\ndementors do that thing to Sirius, he\\'s --\"\\n\\nBut Fudge was shaking his head with a small smile on his face.\\n\\n\"Harry, Harry, you\\'re very confused, you\\'ve been through a dreadful\\nordeal, lie back down, now, we\\'ve got everything under control....\"\\n\\n\"YOU HAVEN\\'T!\" Harry yelled. \"YOUVE GOT THE WRONG MAN!\"\\n\\n\"Minister, listen, please,\" Hermione said; she had hurried to Harry\\'s\\nside and was gazing imploringly into Fudge\\'s face. \"I saw him too. It\\nwas Ron\\'s rat, he\\'s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, and --\"\\n\\n\"You see, Minister?\" said Snape. \"Confunded, both of them.... Black\\'s\\ndone a very good job on them....\" \"WE\\'RE NOT CONFUNDED!\" Harry roared.\\n\\n\"Minister! Professor!\" said Madam Pomfrey angrily. \"I must insist that\\nyou leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be distressed!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not distressed, I\\'m trying to tell them what happened!\" Harry said\\nfuriously. \"If they\\'d just listen --\"\\n\\nBut Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuffed a large chunk of chocolate into\\nHarry\\'s mouth; he choked, and she seized the opportunity to force him\\nback onto the bed.\\n\\n\"Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave\\n\\nThe door opened again. It was Dumbledore. Harry swallowed his mouthful\\nof chocolate with great difficulty and got up again.\\n\\n\"Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black --\"\\n\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake!\" said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. \"Is this a\\nhospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist --\"\\n\\n\"My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and Miss\\nGranger,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"I have just been talking to Sirius\\nBlack --\"\\n\\n\"I suppose he\\'s told you the same fairy tale he\\'s planted in Potter\\'s\\nmind?\" spat Snape. \"Something about a rat, and Pettigrew being alive --\"\\n\\n\"That, indeed, is Black\\'s story,\" said Dumbledore, surveying Snape\\nclosely through his half-moon spectacles.\\n\\n\"And does my evidence count for nothing?\" snarled Snape. \"Peter\\nPettigrew was not in the Shrieking Shack, nor did I see any sign of him\\non the grounds.\"\\n\\n\"That was because you were knocked out, Professor!\" said Hermione\\nearnestly. \"You didn\\'t arrive in time to hear\\n\\n\"Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!\"\\n\\n\"Now, Snape,\" said Fudge, startled, \"the young lady is disturbed in her\\nmind, we must make allowances --\"\\n\\n\"I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\" said Dumbledore\\nabruptly. \"Cornelius, Severus, Poppy -- please leave us.\"\\n\\n\"Headmaster!\" sputtered Madam Pomfrey. \"They need treatment, they need\\nrest --\"\\n\\n\"This cannot wait,\" said Dumbledore. \"I must insist.\"\\n\\nMadam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office at the end\\nof the ward, slamming the door behind her. Fudge consulted the large\\ngold pocket watch dangling from his waistcoat.\\n\\n\"The dementors should have arrived by now,\" he said. \"I\\'ll go and meet\\nthem. Dumbledore, I\\'ll see you upstairs.\"\\n\\nHe crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape hadn\\'t\\nmoved.\\n\\n\"You surely don\\'t believe a word of Black\\'s story?\" Snape whispered, his\\neyes fixed on Dumbledore\\'s face.\\n\\n\"I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,\" Dumbledore repeated.\\n\\nSnape took a step toward Dumbledore.\\n\\n\"Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of sixteen,\" he\\nbreathed. \"You haven\\'t forgotten that, Headmaster? You haven\\'t forgotten\\nthat he once tried to kill me?\"\\n\\n\"My memory is as good as it ever was, Severus,\" said Dumbledore quietly.\\n\\nSnape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge was still\\nholding. It closed behind them, and Dumbledore turned to Harry and\\nHermione. They both burst into speech at the same time.\\n\\n\"Professor, Black\\'s telling the truth -- we saw Pettigrew \"-- he escaped\\nwhen Professor Lupin turned into a werewolf --\"\\n\\n\"-- he\\'s a rat --\"\\n\\n\"-- Pettigrew\\'s front paw, I mean, finger, he cut it off --\"\\n\\n\"-- Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn\\'t Sirius --\"\\n\\nBut Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations.\\n\\n\"It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because\\nthere is very little time,\" he said quietly. \"There is not a shred of\\nproof to support Black\\'s story, except your word -- and the word of two\\nthirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of\\neyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave\\nevidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters\\'\\nSecret-Keeper.\"\\n\\n\"Professor Lupin can tell you --\" Harry said, unable to stop himself\\n\\n\"Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone\\nanything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius\\nwill be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted\\nby most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and\\nthe fact that he and Sirius are old friends --\"\\n\\n\"But --\"\\n\\n\"Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must see\\nthat Professor Snape\\'s version of events is far more convincing than\\nyours.\"\\n\\n\"He hates Sirius,\" Hermione said desperately. \"All because of some\\nstupid trick Sirius played on him --\"\\n\\n\"Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady\\n-- entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife -- without Pettigrew, alive or\\ndead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius\\'s sentence.\"\\n\\n\"But you believe us.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I do,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"But I have no power to make other\\nmen see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic....\"\\n\\nHarry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground\\nbeneath him were falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea\\nthat Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull\\nsome amazing solution out of the air. But no ... their last hope was\\ngone.\\n\\n\"What we need,\" said Dumbledore slowly, and his light blue eyes moved\\nfrom Harry to Hermione, \"is more time.\"\\n\\n\"But --\" Hermione began. And then her eyes became very round. \"OH!\"\\n\\n\"Now, pay attention,\" said Dumbledore, speaking very low, and very\\nclearly. \"Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick\\'s office on the seventh\\nfloor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower. If all goes\\nwell, you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight. But\\nremember this, both of you: you must not be seen. Miss Granger, you know\\nthe law -- you know what is at stake.... You -- must -- not -- be --\\nseen.\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had turned on his\\nheel and looked back as he reached the door.\\n\\n\"I am going to lock you in. It is --\" he consulted his watch, \"five\\nminutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good luck.\"\\n\\n\"Good luck?\" Harry repeated as the door closed behind Dumbledore. \"Three\\nturns? What\\'s he talking about? What are we supposed to do?\"\\n\\nBut Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling from\\nbeneath them a very long, very fine gold chain.\\n\\n\"Harry, come here,\" she said urgently. \"Quick!\"\\n\\nHarry moved toward her, completely bewildered. She was holding the chain\\nout. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it.\\n\\n\"Here --\"\\n\\nShe had thrown the chain around his neck too.\\n\\n\"Ready?\" she said breathlessly.\\n\\n\"What are we doing?\" Harry said, completely lost.\\n\\nHermione turned the hourglass over three times.\\n\\nThe dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was flying very\\nfast, backward. A blur of colors and shapes rushed past him, his ears\\nwere pounding, he tried to yell but couldn\\'t hear his own voice --\\n\\nAnd then he felt solid ground beneath his feet, and everything came into\\nfocus again --\\n\\nHe was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall and a\\nstream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor from the\\nopen front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the\\nhourglass cutting into his neck.\\n\\n\"Hermione, what --?\"\\n\\n\"In here!\" Hermione seized Harry\\'s arm and dragged him across the hall\\nto the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him inside among\\nthe buckets and mops, then slammed the door behind them.\\n\\n\"What -- how -- Hermione, what happened?\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ve gone back in time,\" Hermione whispered, lifting the chain off\\nHarry\\'s neck in the darkness. \"Three hours back...\"\\n\\nHarry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a lot,\\nwhich seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a very\\nbizarre dream.\\n\\n\"But --\"\\n\\n\"Shh! Listen! Someone\\'s coming! I think -- I think it might be us!\"\\nHermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door.\\n\\n\"Footsteps across the hall... yes, I think it\\'s us going down to\\nHagrid\\'s!\"\\n\\n\"Are you telling me,\" Harry whispered, \"that we\\'re here in this cupboard\\nand we\\'re out there too?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. \"I\\'m\\nsure it\\'s us. It doesn\\'t sound like more than three people... and we\\'re\\nwalking slowly because we\\'re under the Invisibility Cloak -- \"\\n\\nShe broke off, still listening intently.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve gone down the front steps....\"\\n\\nHermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately anxious,\\nbut Harry wanted a few questions answered.\\n\\n\"Where did you get that hourglass thing?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s called a Time-Turner,\" Hermione whispered, \"and I got it from\\nProfessor McGonagall on our first day back. I\\'ve been using it all year\\nto get to all my lessons. Professor McGonagall made me swear I wouldn\\'t\\ntell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to the Ministry of\\nMagic so I could have one. She had to tell them that I was a model\\nstudent, and that I\\'d never, ever use it for anything except my\\nstudies.... I\\'ve been turning it back so I could do hours over again,\\nthat\\'s how I\\'ve been doing several lessons at once, see? But...\\n\\n\"Harry, I don\\'t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why did he\\ntell us to go back three hours? How\\'s that going to help Sirius?\"\\n\\nHarry stared at her shadowy face.\\n\\n\"There must be something that happened around now he wants us to\\nchange,\" he said slowly. \"What happened? We were walking down to\\nHagrid\\'s three hours ago....\"\\n\\n\"This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid\\'s,\" said\\nHermione. \"We just heard ourselves leaving....\"\\n\\nHarry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole brain in\\nconcentration.\\n\\n\"Dumbledore just said -- just said we could save more than one innocent\\nlife....\" And then it hit him. \"Hermione, we\\'re going to save Buckbeak!\"\\n\\n\"But -- how will that help Sirius?\"\\n\\n\"Dumbledore said -- he just told us where the window is -- the window of\\nFlitwick\\'s office! Where they\\'ve got Sirius locked up! We\\'ve got to fly\\nBuckbeak up to the window and rescue Sirius! Sirius can escape on\\nBuckbeak -- they can escape together!\"\\n\\nFrom what Harry could see of Hermione\\'s face, she looked terrified.\\n\\n\"If we manage that without being seen, it\\'ll be a miracle!\"\\n\\n\"Well, we\\'ve got to try, haven\\'t we?\" said Harry. He stood up and\\npressed his ear against the door. \"Doesn\\'t sound like anyone\\'s there....\\nCome on, let\\'s go.\"\\n\\nHarry pushed open the closet door. The entrance hall was deserted. As\\nquietly and quickly as they could, they darted out of the closet and\\ndown the stone steps. The shadows were already lengthening, the tops of\\nthe trees in the Forbidden Forest gilded once more with gold.\\n\\n\"If anyone\\'s looking out of the window --\" Hermione squeaked, looking up\\nat the castle behind them.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll run for it,\" said Harry determinedly. \"Straight into the forest,\\nall right? We\\'ll have to hide behind a tree or something and keep a\\nlookout --\"\\n\\n\"Okay, but we\\'ll go around by the greenhouses!\" said Hermione\\nbreathlessly. \"We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid\\'s front door, or\\nwe\\'ll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid\\'s by now!\"\\n\\nStill working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, Hermione\\nbehind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to the greenhouses,\\npaused for a moment behind them, then set off again, fast as they could,\\nskirting around the Whomping Willow, tearing toward the shelter of the\\nforest....\\n\\nSafe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds later,\\nHermione arrived beside him, panting.\\n\\n\"Right,\" she gasped. \"We need to sneak over to Hagrid\\'s.... Keep out of\\nsight, Harry....\"\\n\\nThey made their way silently through the trees, keeping to the very edge\\nof the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of Hagrid\\'s house, they\\nheard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trunk\\nand peered out from either side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway,\\nshaking and white, looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry\\nheard his own voice.\\n\\n\"It\\'s us. We\\'re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we can\\ntake it off.\"\\n\\n\"Yeh shouldn\\'ve come!\" Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then shut the\\ndoor quickly.\\n\\n\"This is the weirdest thing we\\'ve ever done,\" Harry said fervently.\\n\\n\"Let\\'s move along a bit,\" Hermione whispered. \"We need to get nearer to\\nBuckbeak!\"\\n\\nThey crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hippogriff,\\ntethered to the fence around Hagrid\\'s pumpkin patch.\\n\\n\"Now?\" Harry whispered.\\n\\n\"No!\" said Hermione. \"If we steal him now, those Committee people will\\nthink Hagrid set him free! We\\'ve got to wait until they\\'ve seen he\\'s\\ntied outside!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s going to give us about sixty seconds,\" said Harry. This was\\nstarting to seem impossible.\\n\\nAt that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside Hagrid\\'s\\ncabin.\\n\\n\"That\\'s Hagrid breaking the milk jug,\" Hermione whispered. \"I\\'m going to\\nfind Scabbers in a moment --\"\\n\\nSure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione\\'s shriek of\\nsurprise.\\n\\n\"Hermione,\" said Harry suddenly, \"what if we -- we just run in there and\\ngrab Pettigrew --\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Hermione in a terrified whisper. \"Don\\'t you understand? We\\'re\\nbreaking one of the most important wizarding laws! Nobody\\'s supposed to\\nchange time, nobody! You heard Dumbledore, if we\\'re seen --\"\\n\\n\"We\\'d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!\"\\n\\n\"Harry, what do you think you\\'d do if you saw yourself bursting into\\nHagrid\\'s house?\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"I\\'d -- I\\'d think I\\'d gone mad,\" said Harry, \"or I\\'d think there was\\nsome Dark Magic going on --\"\\n\\n\"Exactly! You wouldn\\'t understand, you might even attack yourself! Don\\'t\\nyou see? Professor McGonagall told me what awful things have happened\\nwhen wizards have meddled with time.... Loads of them ended up killing\\ntheir past or future selves by mistake!\"\\n\\n\"Okay!\" said Harry. \"It was just an idea, I just thought\\n\\nBut Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. Harry moved his\\nhead a few inches to get a clear view of the distant front doors.\\nDumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner\\nwere coming down the steps.\\n\\n\"We\\'re about to come out!\" Hermione breathed.\\n\\nAnd sure enough, moments later, Hagrid\\'s back door opened, and Harry saw\\nhimself, Ron, and Hermione walking out of it with Hagrid. It was,\\nwithout a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, standing behind\\nthe tree, and watching himself in the pumpkin patch.\\n\\n\"It\\'s Okay, Beaky, it\\'s okay...\" Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then he turned\\nto Harry, Ron, and Hermione. \"Go on. Get goin\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Hagrid, we can\\'t --\"\\n\\n\"We\\'ll tell them what really happened\\n\\n\"They can\\'t kill him --\"\\n\\n\"Go! It\\'s bad enough without you lot in trouble an\\' all!\"\\n\\nHarry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the Invisibility\\nCloak over him and Ron.\\n\\n\"Go quick. Don\\' listen....\"\\n\\nThere was a knock on Hagrid\\'s front door. The execution party had\\narrived. Hagrid turned, around and headed back into his cabin, leaving\\nthe back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in patches all\\naround the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreating. He, Ron, and\\nHermione had gone... but the Harry and Hermione hidden in the trees\\ncould now hear what was happening inside the cabin through the back\\ndoor.\\n\\n\"Where is the beast?\" came the cold voice of Macnair.\\n\\n\"Out -- outside,\" Hagrid croaked.\\n\\nHarry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair\\'s face appeared at\\nHagrid\\'s window, staring out at Buckbeak. Then they heard Fudge.\\n\\n\"We -- er -- have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid.\\nI\\'ll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair,\\nYou\\'re supposed to listen too, that\\'s procedure --\"\\n\\nMacnair\\'s face vanished from the window. It was now or never.\\n\\n\"Wait here,\" Harry whispered to Hermione. \"I\\'ll do it.\"\\n\\nAs Fudge\\'s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his tree,\\nvaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached Buckbeak.\\n\\n\"It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous\\nCreatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,\\nshall he executed on the sixth of June at sundown --\"\\n\\nCareful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak\\'s fierce orange eyes\\nonce more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees and then stood up\\nagain. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the\\nfence.\\n\\n\"... sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the\\nCommittee\\'s appointed executioner, Walden Macnai...\"\\n\\n\"Come on, Buckbeak,\" Harry murmured, \"come on, we\\'re going to help you.\\nQuietly... quietly...\"\\n\\n\"... as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here...\"\\n\\nHarry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug in his\\nfront feet.\\n\\n\"Well, let\\'s get this over with,\" said the reedy voice of the Committee\\nmember from inside Hagrid\\'s cabin. \"Hagrid, perhaps it will be better if\\nyou stay inside --\"\\n\\n\"No, I -- I wan\\' ter be with him.... I don\\' wan\\' him ter be alone --\"\\n\\nFootsteps echoed from within the cabin.\\n\\n\"Buckbeak, move!\" Harry hissed.\\n\\nHarry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak\\'s neck. The hippogriff\\nbegan to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still ten feet\\naway from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid\\'s back door. \"One moment,\\nplease, Macnair,\" came Dumbledore\\'s voice. \"You need to sign too.\" The\\nfootsteps stopped. Harry heaved on the rope. Buckbeak snapped his beak\\nand walked a little faster.\\n\\nHermione\\'s white face was sticking out from behind a tree.\\n\\n\"Harry, hurry!\" she mouthed.\\n\\nHarry could still hear Dumbledore\\'s voice talking from within the cabin.\\nHe gave the rope another wrench. Buckbeak broke into a grudging trot.\\nThey had reached the trees....\\n\\n\"Quick! Quick!\" Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree,\\nseizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster.\\nHarry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they\\ncouldn\\'t see Hagrid\\'s garden at all.\\n\\n\"Stop!\" he whispered to Hermione. \"They might hear us\\n\\nHagrid\\'s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, and Buckbeak\\nstood quite still; even the hippogriff seemed to be listening intently.\\n\\nSilence... then --\\n\\n\"Where is it?\" said the reedy voice of the Committee member. \"Where is\\nthe beast?\"\\n\\n\"It was tied here!\" said the executioner furiously. I saw it! just\\nhere!\"\\n\\n\"How extraordinary,\" said Dumbledore. There was a note of amusement in\\nhis voice.\\n\\n\"Beaky!\" said Hagrid huskily.\\n\\nThere was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The executioner\\nseemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then came the\\nhowling, and this time they could hear Hagrid\\'s words through his sobs.\\n\\n\"Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he\\'s gone! Musta pulled himself\\nfree! Beaky, yeh clever boy!\"\\n\\nBuckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to\\nHagrid. Harry and Hermione tightened their grip and dug their heels into\\nthe forest floor to stop him.\\n\\n\"Someone untied him!\" the executioner was snarling. \"We should search\\nthe grounds, the forest.\"\\n\\n\"Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really think the\\nthief will have led him away on foot?\" said Dumbledore, still sounding\\namused. \"Search the skies, if you will.... Hagrid, I could do with a cup\\nof tea. Or a large brandy.\"\\n\\n\"O\\' -- o\\' course, Professor,\" said Hagrid, who sounded weak with\\nhappiness. \"Come in, come in....\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione listened closely. They heard footsteps, the soft\\ncursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then silence once\\nmore.\\n\\n\"Now what?\" whispered Harry, looking around.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll have to hide in here,\" said Hermione, who looked very shaken. \"We\\nneed to wait until they\\'ve gone back to the castle. Then we wait until\\nit\\'s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius\\'s window. He won\\'t be there for\\nanother couple of hours.... Oh, this is going to be difficult....\"\\n\\nShe looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the forest.\\nThe sun was setting now.\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to have to move,\" said Harry, thinking hard. \"We\\'ve got to\\nbe able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won\\'t know what\\'s going on.\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak\\'s rope. \"But\\nwe\\'ve got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember....\"\\n\\nThey moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling thickly\\naround them, until they were hidden behind a clump of trees through\\nwhich they could make out the Willow.\\n\\n\"There\\'s Ron!\" said Harry suddenly.\\n\\nA dark figure was sprinting across the lawn and its shout echoed through\\nthe still night air.\\n\\n\"Get away from him -- get away -- Scabbers, come here --\"\\n\\nAnd then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. Harry\\nwatched himself and Hermione chasing after Ron. Then he saw Ron dive.\\n\\n\"Gotcha! Get off, you stinking cat --\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s Sirius!\" said Harry. The great shape of the dog had bounded out\\nfrom the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl Harry over, then seize\\nRon....\\n\\n\"Looks even worse from here, doesn\\'t it?\" said Harry, watching the dog\\npulling Ron into the roots. \"Ouch -- look, I just got walloped by the\\ntree -- and so did you -- this is weird--\"\\n\\nThe Whomping Willow was creaking and lashing out with its lower\\nbranches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to\\nreach the trunk. And then the tree froze.\\n\\n\"That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\"And there we go...\" Harry muttered. \"We\\'re in.\"\\n\\nThe moment they disappeared, the tree began to move again. Seconds\\nlater, they heard footsteps quite close by. Dumbledore, Macnair, Fudge,\\nand the old Committee member were making their way up to the castle.\\n\\n\"Right after we\\'d gone down into the passage!\" said Hermione. \"If only\\nDumbledore had come with us...\"\\n\\n\"Macnair and Fudge would\\'ve come too,\" said Harry bitterly. \"I bet you\\nanything Fudge would\\'ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on the spot....\"\\n\\nThey watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear from\\nview. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then --\\n\\n\"Here comes Lupin!\" said Harry as they saw another figure sprinting down\\nthe stone steps and hating toward the Willow. Harry looked up at the\\nsky. Clouds were obscuring the moon completely.\\n\\nThey watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and prod the\\nknot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, too,\\ndisappeared into the gap in its roots.\\n\\n\"If he\\'d only grabbed the cloak,\" said Harry. \"It\\'s just lying\\nthere....\"\\n\\nHe turned to Hermione.\\n\\n\"If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape\\'d never be able to get\\nit and --\"\\n\\n\"Harry, we mustn\\'t be seen!\"\\n\\n\"How can you stand this?\" he asked Hermione fiercely. \"Just standing\\nhere and watching it happen?\" He hesitated. \"I\\'m going to grab the\\ncloak!\"\\n\\n\"Harry, no!\"\\n\\nHermione seized the back of Harry\\'s robes not a moment too soon. just\\nthen, they heard a burst of song. It was Hagrid, making his way up to\\nthe castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weaving slightly as he\\nwalked. A large bottle was swinging from his hands.\\n\\n\"See?\" Hermione whispered. \"See what would have happened? We\\'ve got to\\nkeep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!\"\\n\\nThe hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid again; Harry\\nseized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. They watched\\nHagrid meander tipsily up to the castle. He was gone. Buckbeak stopped\\nfighting to get away. His head drooped sadly.\\n\\nBarely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, and\\nSnape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow.\\n\\nHarry\\'s fists clenched as they watched Snape skid to a halt next to the\\ntree, looking around. He grabbed the cloak and held it up.\\n\\n\"Get your filthy hands off it,\" Harry snarled under his breath. \"Shh!\"\\n\\nSnape seized the branch Lupin had used to freeze the tree, prodded the\\nknot, and vanished from view as he put on the cloak.\\n\\n\"So that\\'s it,\" said Hermione quietly. \"We\\'re all down there... and now\\nwe\\'ve just got to wait until we come back up again....\"\\n\\nShe took the end of Buckbeak\\'s rope and tied it securely around the\\nnearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees.\\n\\n\"Harry, there\\'s something I don\\'t understand.... Why didn\\'t the\\ndementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed\\nout... there were so many of them....\"\\n\\nHarry sat down too. He explained what he\\'d seen; how, as the nearest\\ndementor had lowered its mouth to Harry\\'s, a large silver something had\\ncome galloping across the lake and forced the dementors to retreat.\\n\\nHermione\\'s mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished.\\n\\n\"But what was it?\"\\n\\n\"There\\'s only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go,\"\\nsaid Harry. \"A real Patronus. A powerful one.\"\\n\\n\"But who conjured it?\"\\n\\nHarry didn\\'t say anything. He was thinking back to the person he\\'d seen\\non the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but\\nhow could it have been?\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t you see what they looked like?\" said Hermione eagerly. \"Was it\\none of the teachers?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Harry. \"He wasn\\'t a teacher.\"\\n\\n\"But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those\\ndementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn\\'t it\\nlight him up? Couldn\\'t you see --?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I saw him,\" said Harry slowly. \"But... maybe I imagined it.... I\\nwasn\\'t thinking straight.... I passed out right afterward....\"\\n\\n\"Who did you think it was?\"\\n\\nI think --\" Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was going to\\nsound. I think it was my dad.\"\\n\\nHarry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully open now.\\nShe was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity.\\n\\n\"Harry, your dad\\'s -- well -- dead,\" she said quietly.\\n\\n\"I know that,\" said Harry quickly.\\n\\n\"You think you saw his ghost?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know... no... he looked solid....\"\\n\\n\"But then --\"\\n\\n\"Maybe I was seeing things,\" said Harry. \"But... from what I could\\nsee... it looked like him.... I\\'ve got photos of him....\"\\n\\nHermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity.\\n\\nI know it sounds crazy,\" said Harry flatly. He turned to took at\\nBuckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching\\nfor worms. But he wasn\\'t really watching Buckbeak.\\n\\nHe was thinking about his father and about his father\\'s three oldest\\nfriends... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.... Had all four of them\\nbeen out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening\\nwhen everyone had thought he was dead.... Was it so impossible his\\nfather had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the take? The\\nfigure had been too far away to see distinctly... yet he had felt sure,\\nfor a moment, before he\\'d lost consciousness....\\n\\nThe leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in\\nand out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione sat with her face\\nturned toward the Willow, waiting.\\n\\nAnd then, at last, after over an hour...\\n\\n\"Here we come!\" Hermione whispered.\\n\\nShe and Harry got to their feet. Buckbeak raised his head. They saw\\nLupin, Ron, and Pettigrew clambering awkwardly out of the hole in the\\nroots. Then came Hermione... then the unconscious Snape, drifting\\nweirdly upward. Next came Harry and Black. They all began to walk toward\\nthe castle.\\n\\nHarry\\'s heart was starting to beat very fast. He glanced up at the sky.\\nAny moment now, that cloud was going to move aside and show the moon....\\n\\n\"Harry,\" Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he was\\nthinking, \"we\\'ve got to stay put. We mustn\\'t be seen. There\\'s nothing we\\ncan do....\"\\n\\n\"So we\\'re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again.. said Harry\\nquietly.\\n\\n\"How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?\" snapped Hermione.\\n\"There\\'s nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we\\'re not\\nsupposed to be doing anything else!\"\\n\\n\"All right!\"\\n\\nThe moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny figures\\nacross the grounds stop. Then they saw movement --\\n\\n\"There goes Lupin,\" Hermione whispered. \"He\\'s transforming\\n\\n\"Hermione!\" said Harry suddenly. \"We\\'ve got to move!\"\\n\\n\"We mustn\\'t, I keep telling you --\"\\n\\n\"Not to interfere! Lupin\\'s going to run into the forest, right at us!\"\\n\\nHermione gasped.\\n\\n\"Quick!\" she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. \"Quick! Where are we\\ngoing to go? Where are we going to hide? The dementors wilt be coming\\nany moment --\"\\n\\n\"Back to Hagrid\\'s!\" Harry said. \"It\\'s empty now -- come on!\"\\n\\nThey ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along behind them.\\nThey could hear the werewolf howling behind them....\\n\\nThe cabin was in sight; Harry skidded to the door, wrenched it open, and\\nHermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw himself in after\\nthem and bolted the door. Fang the boarhound barked loudly.\\n\\n\"Shh, Fang, it\\'s us!\" said Hermione, hurrying over and scratching his\\nears to quieten him. \"That was really close!\" she said to Harry.\\n\\n\"Yeah...\"\\n\\nHarry was looking out of the window. It was much harder to see what was\\ngoing on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find himself back\\ninside Hagrid\\'s house. He lay down in front of the fire, folded his\\nwings contentedly, and seemed ready for a good nap.\\n\\n\"I think I\\'d better go outside again, you know,\" said Harry slowly. \"I\\ncan\\'t see what\\'s going on -- we won\\'t know when it\\'s time --\"\\n\\nHermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not going to try and interfere,\" said Harry quickly. \"But if we\\ndon\\'t see what\\'s going on, how\\'re we going to know when it\\'s time to\\nrescue Sirius?\"\\n\\n\"Well... okay, then... I\\'ll wait here with Buckbeak... but Harry, be\\ncareful -- there\\'s a werewolf out there -- and the dementors\\n\\nHarry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He could hear\\nyelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on\\nSirius.... He and Hermione would be running to him any moment....\\n\\nHarry stared out toward the lake, his heart doing a kind of drumroll in\\nhis chest.... Whoever had sent that Patronus would be appearing at any\\nmoment....\\n\\nFor a fraction of a second he stood, irresolute, in front of Hagrid\\'s\\ndoor. You must not be seen. But he didn\\'t want to be seen. He wanted to\\ndo the seeing.... He had to know...\\n\\nAnd there were the dementors. They were emerging out of the darkness\\nfrom every direction, gliding around the edges of the lake.... They were\\nmoving away from where Harry stood, to the opposite bank.... He wouldn\\'t\\nhave to get near them....\\n\\nHarry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his father...\\nIf it was him... if it really was him... he had to know, had to find\\nout....\\n\\nThe lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of anybody.\\nOn the opposite bank, he could see tiny glimmers of silver -- his own\\nattempts at a Patronus --\\n\\nThere was a bush at the very edge of the water. Harry threw himself\\nbehind it, peering desperately through the leaves. On the opposite bank,\\nthe glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. A terrified\\nexcitement shot through him -- any moment now --\\n\\n\"Come on!\" he muttered, staring about. \"Where are you? Dad, come on --\"\\n\\nBut no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of\\ndementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It was\\ntime for the rescuer to appear -- but no one was coming to help this\\ntime --\\n\\nAnd then it hit him -- he understood. He hadn\\'t seen his father -- he\\nhad seen himself --\\n\\nHarry flung himself out from behind the bush and pulled out his wand.\\n\\n\"EXPECTO PATRONUM! \"he yelled.\\n\\nAnd out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of mist, but\\na blinding, dazzling, silver animal. He screwed up his eyes, trying to\\nsee what it was. It looked like a horse. It was galloping silently away\\nfrom him, across the black surface of the lake. He saw it lower its head\\nand charge at the swarming dementors.... Now it was galloping around and\\naround the black shapes on the ground, and the dementors were falling\\nback, scattering, retreating into the darkness.... They were gone.\\n\\nThe Patronus turned. It was cantering back toward Harry across the still\\nsurface of the water. It wasn\\'t a horse. It wasn\\'t a unicorn, either. It\\nwas a stag. It was shining brightly as the moon above ... it was coming\\nback to him....\\n\\nIt stopped on the bank. Its hooves made no mark on the soft ground as it\\nstared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it bowed its\\nantlered head. And Harry realized... \"Prongs, \"he whispered.\\n\\nBut as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it\\nvanished.\\n\\nHarry stood there, hand still outstretched. Then, with a great leap of\\nhis heart, he heard hooves behind him -he whirled around and saw\\nHermione dashing toward him, dragging Buckbeak behind her.\\n\\n\"What did you do?\" she said fiercely. \"You said you were only going to\\nkeep a lookout!\"\\n\\n\"I just saved all our lives...,\" said Harry. \"Get behind here -- behind\\nthis bush -- I\\'ll explain.\"\\n\\nHermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth open yet\\nagain.\\n\\n\"Did anyone see you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, haven\\'t you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was my dad!\\nIt\\'s okay!\"\\n\\n\"Harry, I can\\'t believe it.... You conjured up a Patronus that drove\\naway all those dementors! That\\'s very, very advanced magic. I knew I\\ncould do it this time,\" said Harry, \"because I\\'d already done it....\\nDoes that make sense?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know -- Harry, look at Snape!\"\\n\\nTogether they peered around the bush at the other bank. Snape had\\nregained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lifting the limp\\nforms of Harry, Hermione, and Black onto them. A fourth stretcher, no\\ndoubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out\\nin front of him, he moved them away toward the castle.\\n\\n\"Right, it\\'s nearly time,\" said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch.\\n\"We\\'ve got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to\\nthe hospital wing. We\\'ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward\\nbefore anybody realizes we\\'re missing.... 11\\n\\nThey waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, while the\\nbush next to them whispered in the breeze. Buckbeak, bored, was\\nferreting for worms again.\\n\\n\"D\\' you reckon he\\'s up there yet?\" said Harry, checking his watch. He\\nlooked up at the castle and began counting the windows to the right of\\nthe West Tower.\\n\\n\"Look!\" Hermione whispered. \"\\\\Who\\'s that? Someone\\'s coming back out of\\nthe castle!\"\\n\\nHarry stared through the darkness. The man was hurrying across the\\ngrounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny glinted in his\\nbelt.\\n\\n\"Macnair!\" said Harry. \"The executioner! He\\'s gone to get the dementors!\\nThis is it, Hermione --\"\\n\\nHermione put her hands on Buckbeak\\'s back and Harry gave her a leg up.\\nThen he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of the bush and\\nclimbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak\\'s rope back over his neck\\nand tied it to the other side of his collar like reins.\\n\\n\"Ready?\" he whispered to Hermione. \"YotM better hold on to me --\\n\\nHe nudged Buckbeak\\'s sides with his heels.\\n\\nBuckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his flanks\\nwith his knees, feeling the great wings rising powerfully beneath them.\\nHermione was holding Harry very tight around the waist; he could hear\\nher muttering, \"Oh, no -- I don\\'t like this oh, I really don\\'t like this\\n--\"\\n\\nHarry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly toward the upper\\nfloors of the castle.... Harry pulled hard on the left-hand side of the\\nrope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying to count the windows\\nflashing past --\\n\\n\"Whoa!\" he said, pulling backward as hard as he could.\\n\\nBuckbeak slowed down and they found themselves at a stop, unless you\\ncounted the fact that they kept rising up and down several feet as the\\nhippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne.\\n\\n\"He\\'s there!\" Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside the\\nwindow. He reached out, and as Buckbeak\\'s wings fell, was able to tap\\nsharply on the glass.\\n\\nBlack looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his chair,\\nhurried to the window and tried to open it, but it was locked.\\n\\n\"Stand back!\" Hermione called to him, and she took out her wand, still\\ngripping the back of Harry\\'s robes with her left hand.\\n\\n\"Alohomora!\"\\n\\nThe window sprang open.\\n\\n\"How -- how --?\" said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff\\n\\n\"Get on -- there\\'s not much time,\" said Harry, gripping Buckbeak firmly\\non either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. \"You\\'ve got to get\\nout of here -the dementors are coming -- Macnair\\'s gone to get them.\"\\n\\nBlack placed a hand on either side of the window frame and heaved his\\nhead and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so thin. In\\nseconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak\\'s back and pull\\nhimself onto the hippogriff behind Hermione.\\n\\n\"Okay, Buckbeak, up!\" said Harry, shaking the rope. \"Up to the tower --\\ncome on.\\n\\nThe hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were soaring\\nupward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak landed with a\\nclatter on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione slid off him at once.\\n\\n\"Sirius, you\\'d better go, quick,\" Harry panted. \"They\\'ll reach\\nFlitwick\\'s office any moment, they\\'ll find out you\\'re gone.\"\\n\\nBuckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.\\n\\n\"What happened to the other boy? Ron?\" croaked Sirius.\\n\\n\"He\\'s going to be okay. He\\'s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey says\\nshe\\'ll be able to make him better. Quick -- go --\"\\n\\nBut Black was still staring down at Harry.\\n\\n\"How can I ever thank --\"\\n\\n\"GO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted together.\\n\\nBlack wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky.\\n\\n\"We\\'ll see each other again,\" he said. \"You are -- truly your father\\'s\\nson, Harry....\"\\n\\nHe squeezed Buckbeak\\'s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione jumped\\nback as the enormous wings rose once more.... The hippogriff took off\\ninto the air.... He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry\\ngazed after them... then a cloud drifted across the moon.... They were\\ngone.\\n\\nCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\\n\\nOWL POST AGAIN\\n\\nHarry!\"\\n\\nHermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her watch. \"We\\'ve got\\nexactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without\\nanybody seeing us -- before Dumbledore locks the door --\"\\n\\n\"Okay,\" said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, \"let\\'s go....\"\\n\\nThey slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly\\nspiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, they heard\\nvoices. They flattened themselves against the wall and listened. It\\nsounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking quickly along the\\ncorridor at the foot of the staircase.\\n\\n\"... only hope Dumbledore\\'s not going to make difficulties,\" Snape was\\nsaying. \"The Kiss will be performed immediately?\"\\n\\n\"As soon as Macnair returns with the dementors. This whole Black affair\\nhas been highly embarrassing. I can\\'t tell you how much I\\'m looking\\nforward to informing the Daily Prophet that we\\'ve got him at last.... I\\ndaresay they\\'ll want to interview you, Snape... and once young Harry\\'s\\nback in his right mind, I expect he\\'ll want to tell the Prophet exactly\\nhow you saved him....\"\\n\\nHarry clenched his teeth. He caught a glimpse of Snape\\'s smirk as he and\\nFudge passed Harry and Hermione\\'s hiding place. Their footsteps died\\naway. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments to make sure they\\'d really\\ngone, then started to run in the opposite direction. Down one staircase,\\nthen another, along a new ,corridor -- then they heard a cackling ahead.\\n\\n\"Peeves!\" Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione\\'s wrist. \"In here!\"\\n\\nThey tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. Peeves\\nseemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits,\\nlaughing his head off.\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s horrible,\" whispered Hermione, her ear to the door. \"I bet\\nhe\\'s all excited because the dementors are going to finish off\\nSirius....\" She checked her watch. \"Three minutes, Harry!\"\\n\\nThey waited until Peeves\\'s gloating voice had faded into the distance,\\nthen slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.\\n\\n\"Hermione -- what\\'ll happen -- if we don\\'t get back inside before\\nDumbledore locks the door?\" Harry panted.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to think about it!\" Hermione moaned, checking her watch\\nagain. \"One minute!\"\\n\\nThey had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing\\nentrance. \"Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore,\" said Hermione tensely. \"Come\\non, Harry!\"\\n\\nThey crept along the corridor. The door opened. Dumbledore\\'s back\\nappeared.\\n\\n\"I am going to lock you in,\" they heard him saying. \"it is five minutes\\nto midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do It. Good luck.\"\\n\\nDumbledore backed out of the room, closed the door, and took out his\\nwand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione ran forward.\\nDumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared under the long silver\\nmustache. \"Well?\" he said quietly.\\n\\n\"We did it!\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Sirius has gone, on Buckbeak....\"\\n\\nDumbledore beamed at them.\\n\\n\"Well done. I think --\" He listened intently for any sound within the\\nhospital wing. \"Yes, I think you\\'ve gone too -- get inside -- I\\'ll lock\\nyou in --\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione slipped back inside the dormitory. It was empty\\nexcept for Ron, who was still lying motionless in the end bed. As the\\nlock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept back to their own\\nbeds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back under her robes. A moment\\nlater, Madam Pomfrey came striding back out of her office.\\n\\n\"Did I hear the headmaster leaving? Am I allowed to look after my\\npatients now?\"\\n\\nShe was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it best to accept\\ntheir chocolate quietly. Madam Pomfrey stood over them, making sure they\\nate it. But Harry could hardly swallow. He and Hermione were waiting,\\nlistening, their nerves jangling.... And then, as they both took a\\nfourth piece of chocolate from Madam Pomfrey, they heard a distant roar\\nof fury echoing from somewhere above them....\\n\\n\"What was that?\" said Madam Pomfrey in alarm.\\n\\nNow they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. Madam\\nPomfrey was staring at the door.\\n\\n\"Really -- they\\'ll wake everybody up! What do they think they\\'re doing?\"\\n\\nHarry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were drawing\\nnearer --\\n\\n\"He must have Disapparated, Severus. We should have left somebody in the\\nroom with him. When this gets out --\"\\n\\n\"HE DIDN\\'T DISAPPARATE!\" Snape roared, now very close at hand. \"YOU\\nCAN\\'T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE INSIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS -- HAS --\\nSOMETHING -- TO -- DO -- WITH -- POTTER!\"\\n\\n\"Severus -- be reasonable -- Harry has been locked up --\"\\n\\nBAM.\\n\\nThe door of the hospital wing burst open.\\n\\nFudge, Snape, and Dumbledore came striding into the ward. Dumbledore\\nalone looked calm. Indeed, he looked as though he was quite enjoying\\nhimself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was beside himself.\\n\\n\"OUT WITH IT, POTTER!\" he bellowed. \"WHAT DID YOU DO?\"\\n\\n\"Professor Snape!\" shrieked Madam Pomfrey. \"Control yourself!\"\\n\\n\"See here, Snape, be reasonable,\" said Fudge. \"This door\\'s been locked,\\nwe just saw --\"\\n\\n\"THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!\" Snape howled, pointing at Harry and\\nHermione. His face was twisted; spit was flying from his mouth.\\n\\n\"Calm down, man!\" Fudge barked. \"You\\'re talking nonsense!\"\\n\\n\"YOU DON\\'T KNOW POTTER!\" shrieked Snape. \"HE DID IT, I KNOW HE DID IT\\n--\"\\n\\n\"That will do, Severus,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Think about what you\\nare saying. This door has been locked since I left the ward ten minutes\\nago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their beds?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not!\" said Madam Pomfrey, bristling. \"I would have heard\\nthem!\"\\n\\n\"Well, there you have it, Severus,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Unless you\\nare suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at\\nonce, I\\'m afraid I don\\'t see any point in troubling them further.\"\\n\\nSnape stood there, seething, staring from Fudge, who looked thoroughly\\nshocked at his behavior, to Dumbledore, whose eyes were twinkling behind\\nhis glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed\\nout of the ward.\\n\\n\"Fellow seems quite unbalanced,\" said Fudge, staring after him. \"I\\'d\\nwatch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, he\\'s not unbalanced,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"He\\'s just suffered\\na severe disappointment.\"\\n\\n\"He\\'s not the only one!\" puffed Fudge. \"The Daily Prophet\\'s going to\\nhave a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our\\nfingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that\\nhippogriff\\'s escape to get out, and I\\'ll be a laughingstock! Well... I\\'d\\nbetter go and notify the Ministry.....\\n\\n\"And the dementors?\" said Dumbledore. \"They\\'ll be removed from the\\nschool, I trust?\"\\n\\n\"Oh yes, they\\'ll have to go,\" said Fudge, running his fingers\\n\\ndistractedly through his hair. \"Never dreamed they\\'d attempt to\\nadminister the Kiss on an innocent boy... Completely out of control...\\nno, I\\'ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight.... Perhaps we\\nshould think about dragons at the school entrance....\"\\n\\n\"Hagrid would like that,\" said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry and\\nHermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pomfrey hurried to\\nthe door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to herself, she headed\\nback to her office.\\n\\nThere was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had woken up.\\nThey could see him sitting up, rubbing his head, looking around.\\n\\n\"What -- what happened?\" he groaned. \"Harry? Why are we in here? Where\\'s\\nSirius? Where\\'s Lupin? What\\'s going on?\"\\n\\nHarry and Hermione looked at each other.\\n\\n\"You explain,\" said Harry, helping himself to some more chocolate.\\n\\nWhen Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next\\nday, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering, heat and\\nthe end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of\\nanother Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going,\\nhowever, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking\\nabout the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where\\nSirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant\\nsquid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread\\nof the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag\\nhad galloped toward him from there just last night....\\n\\nA shadow fell across them and they looked \\'tip to see a very bleary-eyed\\nHagrid, mopping his sweaty face with one of his tablecloth-sized\\nhandkerchiefs and beaming down at them.\\n\\n\"Know I shouldn\\' feel happy, after wha\\' happened las\\' night,\" he said.\\n\"I mean, Black escapin\\' again, an, everythin\\' -- but guess what?\"\\n\\n\"What?\" they said, pretending to look curious.\\n\\n\"Beaky! He escaped! He\\'s free! Bin celebratin\\' all night!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s wonderful!\" said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look because\\nhe looked as though he was close to laughing.\\n\\n\"Yeah... can\\'t\\'ve tied him up properly,\" said Hagrid, gazing happily out\\nover the grounds. \"I was worried this mornin\\', mind... thought he mighta\\nmet Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin\\'\\nlas\\' night....\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Harry quickly.\\n\\n\"Blimey, haven\\' yeh heard?\" said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. He\\nlowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight. \"Er -- Snape\\ntold all the Slytherins this mornin\\'.... Thought everyone\\'d know by\\nnow... Professor Lupin\\'s a werewolf, see. An\\' he was loose on the\\ngrounds las\\' night.... He\\'s packin\\' now, o\\' course.\\n\\n\"He\\'s packing?\" said Harry, alarmed. \"Why?\"\\n\\n\"Leavin\\', isn\\' he?\" said Hagrid, looking surprised that Harry had to\\nask. \"Resigned firs\\' thing this mornin\\'. Says he can\\'t risk it happenin\\nagain.\\n\\nHarry scrambled to his feet.\\n\\n\"I\\'m going to see him,\" he said to Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n\"But if he\\'s resigned --\"\\n\\n\"-- doesn\\'t sound like there\\'s anything we can do --\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care. I still want to see him. I\\'ll meet you back here.\"\\n\\nLupin\\'s office door was open. He had already packed most of his things.\\nThe grindylow\\'s empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase,\\nwhich was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over something on his\\ndesk and looked up only when Harry knocked on the door.\\n\\n\"I saw you coming,\" said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the parchment he\\nhad been poring over. It was the Marauder\\'s Map.\\n\\n\"I just saw Hagrid,\" said Harry. \"And he said you\\'d resigned. It\\'s not\\ntrue, is it?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m afraid it is,\" said Lupin. He started opening his desk drawers and\\ntaking out the contents.\\n\\n\"Why?\" said Harry. \"The Ministry of Magic don\\'t think you were helping\\nSirius, do they?\"\\n\\nLupin crossed to the door and closed it behind Harry.\\n\\n\"No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I was trying to\\nsave your lives.\" He sighed. \"That was the final straw for Severus. I\\nthink the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So he -- er --\\naccidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning at breakfast.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re not leaving just because of that!\" said Harry.\\n\\nLupin smiled wryly.\\n\\n\"This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from parents.... They\\nwill not want a werewolf teaching their children, Harry. And after last\\nnight, I see their point. I could have bitten any of you.... That must\\nnever happen again.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts- teacher we\\'ve ever had!\"\\nsaid Harry. \"Don\\'t go!\"\\n\\nLupin shook his head and didn\\'t speak. He carried on emptying his\\ndrawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argument to\\nmake him stay, Lupin said, \"From what the headmaster told me this\\nmorning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. if I\\'m proud of\\nanything I\\'ve done this year, it\\'s how much you\\'ve learned.... Tell me\\nabout your Patronus.\"\\n\\n\"How d\\'you know about that?\" said Harry, distracted.\\n\\n\"What else could have driven the dementors back?\"\\n\\nHarry told Lupin what had happened. When he\\'d finished, Lupin was\\nsmiling again.\\n\\n\"Yes, your father was always a stag when he transformed,\" he said. \"You\\nguessed right... that\\'s why we called him Prongs.\"\\n\\nLupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk drawers,\\nand turned to look at Harry.\\n\\n\"Here -- I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,\" he said,\\nhanding Harry back the Invisibility Cloak. \"And...\" He hesitated, then\\nheld out the Marauder\\'s Map too. \"I am no longer your teacher, so I\\ndon\\'t feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It\\'s no use to me,\\nand I daresay you, Ron, and Hermione will find uses for it.\"\\n\\nHarry took the map and grinned.\\n\\n\"You told me Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs would\\'ve wanted to\\nlure me out of school... you said they\\'d have thought it was funny.\"\\n\\n\"And so we would have,\" said Lupin, now reaching down to close his case.\\n\"I have no hesitation in saying that James would have been highly\\ndisappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out\\nof the castle.\"\\n\\nThere was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Marauder\\'s Map\\nand the Invisibility Cloak into his pocket.\\n\\nIt was Professor Dumbledore. He didn\\'t look surprised to see Harry\\nthere.\\n\\n\"Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Thank You, Headmaster.\"\\n\\nLupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank.\\n\\n\"Well -- good-bye, Harry,\" he said, smiling. \"It has been a real\\npleasure teaching you. I feel sure we\\'ll meet again sometime.\\nHeadmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can manage....\"\\n\\nHarry had the impression that Lupin wanted to leave as quickly as\\npossible.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, then, Remus,\" said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin shifted the\\ngrindylow tank slightly so that he and Dumbledore could shake hands.\\nThen, with a final nod to Harry and a swift smile, Lupin left the\\noffice.\\n\\nHarry sat down in his vacated chair, staring glumly at the floor. He\\nheard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there.\\n\\n\"Why so miserable, Harry?\" he said quietly. \"You should be very proud of\\nyourself after last night.\"\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t make any difference,\" said Harry bitterly. \"Pettigrew got\\naway.\"\\n\\n\"Didn\\'t make any difference?\" said Dumbledore quietly, \"It made all the\\ndifference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved\\nan innocent man from a terrible fate.\"\\n\\nTerrible. Something stirred in Harry\\'s memory. Greater and more terrible\\nthan ever before... Professor Trelawney\\'s prediction!\\n\\n\"Professor Dumbledore -- yesterday, when I was having my Divination\\nexam, Professor Trelawney went very -- very strange.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Dumbledore. \"Er -- stranger than usual, you mean?\"\\n\\n\"Yes... her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said ... she\\nsaid Voldemort\\'s servant was going to set out to return to him before\\nmidnight.... She said the servant would help him come back to power.\"\\nHarry stared up at Dumbledore. \"And then she sort of became normal\\nagain, and she couldn\\'t remember anything she\\'d said. Was it -- was she\\nmaking a real prediction?\"\\n\\nDumbledore looked mildly impressed.\\n\\n\"Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been.\" he said thoughtfully.\\n\"Who\\'d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to\\ntwo. I should offer her a pay raise....\"\\n\\n\"But --\" Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so\\ncalmly?\\n\\n\"But -- I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Pettigrew!\\nThat makes it my fault if Voldemort comes back!\"\\n\\n\"It does not,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"Hasn\\'t your experience with the\\nTime-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions\\nare always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a\\nvery difficult business indeed.... Professor Trelawney, bless her, is\\nliving proof of that.... You did a very noble thing, in saving\\nPettigrew\\'s life.\"\\n\\n\"But if he helps Voldemort back to power\\n\\n\"Pettigrew owes his life to you. You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is\\nin your debt.... When one wizard saves another wizard\\'s life, it creates\\na certain bond between them... and I\\'m much mistaken if Voldemort wants\\nhis servant in the debt of Harry Potter.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want a connection with Pettigrew!\" said Harry. \"He betrayed my\\nparents!\"\\n\\n\"This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust\\nme... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew\\'s\\nlife.\"\\n\\nHarry couldn\\'t imagine when that would be. Dumbledore looked as though\\nhe knew what Harry was thinking.\\n\\n\"I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, Harry,\" he\\nsaid gently. \"He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am sure of it.\"\\n\\nHarry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn\\'t laugh -- he could tell\\nDumbledore...\\n\\n\"I thought it was my dad who\\'d conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw\\nmyself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him.\" \"An easy mistake\\nto make,\" said Dumbledore softly. \"I expect you\\'ll tire of hearing it,\\nbut you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes... you\\nhave your mother\\'s eyes.\\n\\nHarry shook his head.\\n\\n\"It was stupid, thinking it was him,\" he muttered. \"I mean, I knew he\\nwas dead.\"\\n\\n\"You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that we\\ndon\\'t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble? Your\\nfather is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most plainly when you\\nhave need of him. How else could you produce that particular Patronus?\\nProngs rode again last night.\"\\n\\nIt took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumblefore had said.\\n\\nLast night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,\" said\\nDumbledore, smiling. \"An extraordinary achievement -- not least, keeping\\nit quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your\\nPatronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match\\nagainst Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father\\nlast night.... You found him inside yourself.\"\\n\\nAnd Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very confused\\nthoughts.\\n\\nNobody at Hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night\\nthat Sirius, Buckbeak, and Pettigrew had vanished except Harry, Ron,\\nHermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry\\nheard many different theories about what had really happened, but none\\nof them came close to the truth.\\n\\nMalfoy was furious about Buckbeak. He was convinced that Hagrid had\\nfound a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety, and seemed outraged\\nthat he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper. Percy\\nWeasley, meanwhile, had much to say on the subject of Sirius\\'s escape.\\n\\n\"If I manage to get into the Ministry, I\\'ll have a lot of proposals to\\nmake about Magical Law Enforcement!\" he told the only person who would\\nlisten -- his girlfriend, Penelope.\\n\\nThough the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so\\n\\ncheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in\\nhelping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of a\\nschool year in worse spirits.\\n\\nHe certainly wasn\\'t the only one who was sorry to see Professor Lupin\\ngo. The whole of Harry\\'s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was\\nmiserable about his resignation.\\n\\n\"Wonder what they\\'ll give us next year?\" said Seamus Finnigan gloomily.\\n\\n\"Maybe a vampire,\" suggested Dean Thomas hopefully.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t only Professor Lupin\\'s departure that was weighing on Harry\\'s\\nmind. He couldn\\'t help thinking a lot about Professor Trelawney\\'s\\nprediction. He kept wondering where Pettigrew was now, whether he had\\nsought sanctuary with Voldemort yet. But the thing that was lowering\\nHarry\\'s spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the\\nDursleys. For maybe half an hour, a glorious half hour, he had believed\\nhe would be living with Sirius from now on... his parents\\' best\\nfriend.... It would have been the next best thing to having his own\\nfather back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely good news,\\nbecause it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, Harry couldn\\'t\\nhelp feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had,\\nand the fact that it was now impossible.\\n\\nThe exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, and\\nHermione had passed every subject. Harry was amazed that he had got\\nthrough Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumbledore might have\\nstepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. Snape\\'s behavior toward\\nHarry over the past week had been quite alarming. Harry wouldn\\'t have\\nthought it possible that Snape\\'s dislike for him could increase, but it\\ncertainly had. A muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape\\'s\\nthin mouth every time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing\\nhis fingers, as though itching to place them around Harry\\'s throat.\\n\\nPercy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had scraped a\\nhandful of O.W.L.s each. Gryffindor House, meanwhile, largely thanks to\\ntheir spectacular performance in the Quidditch Cup, had won the House\\nchampionship for the third year running. This meant that the end of term\\nfeast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold, and that the\\nGryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot, as everybody celebrated.\\nEven Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Dursleys the\\nnext day as he ate, drank, talked, and laughed with the rest.\\n\\nAs the Hogwarts Express pulled out of the station the next mornIng,\\nHermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news.\\n\\n\"I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before breakfast.\\nI\\'ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.\"\\n\\n\"But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent!\" said\\nRon.\\n\\n\"I know,\" sighed Hermione, \"but I can\\'t stand another year like this\\none. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I\\'ve handed it in. Without\\nMuggle Studies and Divination, I\\'ll be able to have a normal schedule\\nagain.\"\\n\\nI still can\\'t believe you didn\\'t tell us about it,\" said Ron grumpily.\\n\"We\\'re supposed to be your friends.\"\\n\\n\"I promised I wouldn\\'t tell anyone,\" said Hermione severely. She looked\\naround at Harry, who was watching Hogwarts disappear from view behind a\\nmountain. Two whole months before he\\'d see it again....\\n\\n\"Oh, cheer up, Harry!\" said Hermione sadly.\\n\\n\"I\\'m okay,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just thinking about the holidays.\"\\n\\n\"Yeah, I\\'ve been thinking about them too,\" said Ron. \"Harry, you\\'ve got\\nto come and stay with us. I\\'ll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I\\'ll\\ncall you. I know how to use a fellytone now --\"\\n\\n\"A telephone, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"Honestly, you should take Muggle\\nStudies next year....\"\\n\\nRon *ignored her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, Harry? Come and\\nstay, and we\\'ll go and see it! Dad can usually get tickets from work.\"\\n\\nThis proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal.\\n\\n\"Yeah... I bet the Dursleys\\'d be pleased to let me come... especially\\nafter what I did to Aunt Marge....\"\\n\\nFeeling considerably more cheerful, Harry joined Ron and Hermione in\\nseveral games of Exploding Snap, and when the witch with the tea cart\\narrived, he bought himself a very large lunch, though nothing with\\nchocolate in it.\\n\\nBut it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly\\nhappy turned up....\\n\\n\"Harry,\" said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. \"What\\'s that\\nthing outside your window?\"\\n\\nHarry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray was bobbing\\nin and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for a better look and\\nsaw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that was much too big for\\nit. The owl was so small, in fact, that it kept tumbling over in the\\nair, buffeted this way and that in the train\\'s slipstream. Harry quickly\\npulled down the window, stretched out his arm, and caught it. It felt\\nlike a very fluffy Snitch. He brought it carefully inside. The owl\\ndropped its letter onto Harry\\'s seat and began zooming around their\\ncompartment, apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its\\ntask. Hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval.\\nCrookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his great yellow\\neyes. Ron, noticing this, snatched the owl safely out of harm\\'s way.\\n\\nHarry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped open the\\nletter, and shouted, \"It\\'s from Sirius!\"\\n\\n\"What?\" said Ron and Hermione excitedly. \"Read it aloud!\"\\n\\nDear Harry,\\n\\nI hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. I don\\'t know\\nwhether they\\'re used to owl post.\\n\\nBuckbeak and I are in hiding. I won\\'t tell you where, in case this owl\\nfalls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt about his reliability, but\\nhe is the best I could find, and he did seem eager for the job.\\n\\nI believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they haven\\'t a\\nhope of finding me here. I am planning to allow some Muggles to glimpse\\nme soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so that the security on the castle\\nwill be lifted.\\n\\nThere is something I never got around to telling you during our brief\\nmeeting. It was I who sent you the Firebolt --\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said Hermione triumphantly. \"See! I told you it was from him!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, but he hadn\\'t jinxed it, had he?\" said Ron. \"Ouch!\" The tiny owl,\\nnow hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his fingers in what\\nit seemed to think was an affectionate way.\\n\\nCrookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used your name\\nbut told them to take the gold from my own Gringotts vault. Please\\nconsider it as thirteen birthdays\\' worth of presents from your\\ngodfather.\\n\\nI would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave you that\\nnight last year when you left your uncle\\'s house. I had only hoped to\\nget a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the\\nsight of me alarmed you.\\n\\nI am enclosing something else for you, which I think will make your next\\nyear at Hogwarts more enjoyable.\\n\\nIf ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me.\\n\\nI\\'ll write again soon.\\n\\nSirius\\n\\nHarry looked eagerly inside the envelope. There was another piece of\\nparchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm\\nand contented as though he\\'d swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one\\ngulp.\\n\\nI, Sirius Black, Harry Potter\\'s godfather, hereby give him permission to\\nvisit Hogsmeade on weekends.\\n\\n\"That\\'ll be good enough for Dumbledore!\" said Harry happily. He looked\\nback at Sirius\\'s letter. \"Hang on, there\\'s a RS....\"\\n\\nI thought your ftiend Ron might like to keep this owl, as it\\'s my fault\\nhe no longer has a rat.\\n\\nRon\\'s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. \"Keep\\nhim?\" he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl for a moment;\\nthen, to Harry\\'s and Hermione\\'s great surprise, he held him out for\\nCrookshanks to sniff.\\n\\n\"What do you reckon?\" Ron asked the cat. \"Definitely an owl?\"\\n\\nCrookshanks purred.\\n\\n\"That\\'s good enough for me,\" said Ron happily. \"He\\'s mine.\"\\n\\nHarry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into\\nKing\\'s Cross station. It was still clutched tightly in his hand as he,\\nRon, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine an(\\'\\nthree-quarters. Harry spotted Uncle Vernon at once. He was standing a\\ngood distance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing them suspiciously, and\\nwhen Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greeting, his worst suspicions about\\nthem seemed confirmed.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll call about the World Cup!\" Ron yelled after Harry as Harry bid him\\nand Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and\\nHedwig\\'s cage toward Uncle Vernon, who greeted him in his usual fashion.\\n\\n\"What\\'s that?\" he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still\\nclutching in his hand. \"If it\\'s another form for me to sign, you\\'ve got\\nanother ---\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not,\" said Harry cheerfully. \"It\\'s a letter from my godfather.\"\\n\\n\"Godfather?\" sputtered Uncle Vernon. \"You haven\\'t got a godfather!\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I have,\" said Harry brightly. \"He was my mum and dad\\'s best\\nfriend. He\\'s a convicted murderer, but he\\'s broken out of wizard prison\\nand he\\'s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep\\nup with my news... check if I\\'m happy...\"\\n\\nAnd, grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon\\'s face,\\nHarry set off toward the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of\\nhim, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.\\n\\nTHE END\\n'"
